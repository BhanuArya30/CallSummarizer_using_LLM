a3b83e0e-077b-4d3a-9d9a-e1ab66edeb2d-0
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.520
Um, So what I'll do is um.

9cbf1130-e709-4ace-85ac-c685ffdd83a2-0
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.541
I'll share my screen and I'll
sort of take you through the new

9cbf1130-e709-4ace-85ac-c685ffdd83a2-1
00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.452
platform. I believe from what
you've said, you might have

9cbf1130-e709-4ace-85ac-c685ffdd83a2-2
00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:13.560
already sort of had a look at it
already.

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-0
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.327
Um, but just to set a bit of
context, this is the 4th

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-1
00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:20.827
iteration. So we spoke on the
first one, which was, um, sort

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-2
00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:24.326
of last year at some point. So
we've progressed a little bit

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-3
00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:27.768
since then. Um, we have added
sort of a lot of features and

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-4
00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:31.152
functionality. This is by no
means the end product, um. So

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-5
00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:34.594
there is still a lot of things
that are missing such as the

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-6
00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:38.208
ability to search. Um, we don't
have all of the data. We don't

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-7
00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.822
have charts and visualizations
yet. This is also coming in the

c5eb90f0-cfd3-4c80-9a71-ccd0f2ccf5aa-8
00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:44.060
future. So with regards to those
pink.

5a1f5abd-8cec-4709-b9f7-ed554d3a283c-0
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.897
Blades and the colorful shades
just, um, that that's kind of

5a1f5abd-8cec-4709-b9f7-ed554d3a283c-1
00:00:46.897 --> 00:00:49.455
just a placeholder at the
minute. Um, so that's not what

5a1f5abd-8cec-4709-b9f7-ed554d3a283c-2
00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:52.102
they're actually gonna look
like. It's it's just sort of a

5a1f5abd-8cec-4709-b9f7-ed554d3a283c-3
00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:54.705
placeholder. So that's subject
to change. But that's good

5a1f5abd-8cec-4709-b9f7-ed554d3a283c-4
00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:56.770
feedback. I could pass that back
to the team.

4ece4ba8-21a2-402d-af81-9e66e3295438-0
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.470
Um, what I'll do is, uh, let me
just share my screen and then.

368b2415-edf2-4f97-a833-3b4fc56eba89-0
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.680
I'll talk through the new
platform.

27320483-3187-496a-9ee2-59e6cb83a9f3-0
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.150
Just let me know if you could
see that I'm there.

84b4c640-2181-416d-bb41-9161dd43cdba-0
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.210
Yeah.

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-0
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.395
You see my mouse moving around?
Yep. Cool. Perfect. So

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-1
00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:29.696
essentially, this is the new
home page. Um, this is very

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-2
00:01:29.696 --> 00:01:32.996
similar to what you would have
seen in the first concept

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-3
00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:36.413
release, so there's not much
change here. The only changes

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-4
00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:39.830
that we've made is this top left
section, so you'll have a

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-5
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.131
welcome dashboard, the ability
to sort of see your saved

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-6
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:46.490
reports, and you could also
create a report straight from

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-7
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.022
here. Everything else has stayed
the same. One thing we have

7da154ce-b4dd-4edc-ad7a-ee1adb824ac1-8
00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:53.150
added since the last time we
spoke is the ability to.

6ef5579f-446b-4b7a-93b0-02bf17ea2dc3-0
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.734
Save a report. So I'll go on to
that in just in just a second,

6ef5579f-446b-4b7a-93b0-02bf17ea2dc3-1
00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.025
but once you have saved a
report, you'll be able to access

6ef5579f-446b-4b7a-93b0-02bf17ea2dc3-2
00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:01.810
that directly in your home page.

e294d0e8-08ca-4865-bb42-f2d8fc6d293e-0
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.229
Um, on that save report. Or you
could see this little icon here

e294d0e8-08ca-4865-bb42-f2d8fc6d293e-1
00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.618
which says my saved. If you
click that you could see your

e294d0e8-08ca-4865-bb42-f2d8fc6d293e-2
00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:13.240
saved reports there as well. Got
a first feedback already. So

e294d0e8-08ca-4865-bb42-f2d8fc6d293e-3
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.629
actually, I mean I would
understand for sure not the only

e294d0e8-08ca-4865-bb42-f2d8fc6d293e-4
00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.076
customer you have. I would
understand if there's customers

e294d0e8-08ca-4865-bb42-f2d8fc6d293e-5
00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:23.816
who think that's very useful for
me, not so much because I I do

e294d0e8-08ca-4865-bb42-f2d8fc6d293e-6
00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:24.050
not.

2c6f765c-283d-451a-a7d4-28c87e95403d-0
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.084
Use reports on a daily basis. So
I don't mind if I have to go a

2c6f765c-283d-451a-a7d4-28c87e95403d-1
00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:32.939
little bit more complicated way
to get there. I mean it's

2c6f765c-283d-451a-a7d4-28c87e95403d-2
00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.061
complicated, it's in the header
basically, right? So actually

2c6f765c-283d-451a-a7d4-28c87e95403d-3
00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:40.916
probably if I were free to
choose, I would prefer to have

2c6f765c-283d-451a-a7d4-28c87e95403d-4
00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:41.980
more meaningful.

7283f224-8922-4974-b7ba-628682a18d54-0
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.993
Current information on on on on
the page, then uh, the old stuff

7283f224-8922-4974-b7ba-628682a18d54-1
00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:47.860
that I saved.

6c5c9ae1-8e06-46ca-b533-00f5e6a7c25e-0
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.725
That makes absolute sense,
because you don't typically use

6c5c9ae1-8e06-46ca-b533-00f5e6a7c25e-1
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:57.650
reports that much, so you'd want
something a little bit different

6c5c9ae1-8e06-46ca-b533-00f5e6a7c25e-2
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.980
than a lot of people would be.

5ba44c9a-953a-4fe0-abaa-3a521d5f1fb2-0
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.535
Probably complicated, I don't
know. But as a customer I don't

5ba44c9a-953a-4fe0-abaa-3a521d5f1fb2-1
00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:06.840
have to care. I guess um would
be great.

f35ca8e1-0547-4f42-8ddf-83c8fcb97876-0
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.720
That's.

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-0
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.363
But as many positions or or
places within the database, if

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-1
00:03:13.363 --> 00:03:17.267
you could provide freedom to the
to the user to customize it. So

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-2
00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:20.991
for example I wouldn't mind if
if that. If that's the way the

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-3
00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:24.714
the platform presents itself on
1st entry, fine. But if the I

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-4
00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:28.378
then could say hey, carve out
the left section, I'm just not

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-5
00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:31.741
interested in that. And by
default then because it's my

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-6
00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:35.585
personalized setting, the whole
thing would never show up again

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-7
00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:39.189
for me and I could choose to
whatever is relevant for me to

0af26cf1-0bf8-4fe0-bcd8-c9aa4e682a0e-8
00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.850
show their.

6356cda1-291c-40c2-859c-c944e567a42f-0
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.260
To show up there as as a
default, that would be a great

6356cda1-291c-40c2-859c-c944e567a42f-1
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.690
feature.

d53bcd0a-68a1-4ade-b5bf-ae7d79c9cf4d-0
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.421
That's another one before I
forget because I don't know if

d53bcd0a-68a1-4ade-b5bf-ae7d79c9cf4d-1
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:52.643
we touch on something that would
remind me. Another really cool

d53bcd0a-68a1-4ade-b5bf-ae7d79c9cf4d-2
00:03:52.643 --> 00:03:56.732
thing would be bulk upload. So
for example if I have an Excel

d53bcd0a-68a1-4ade-b5bf-ae7d79c9cf4d-3
00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.250
sheet with 15 products.

2c3d1667-725f-4d2d-8e7b-d05a733d96ae-0
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.874
And I had the possibility to to
bulk upload those 15 generic or

2c3d1667-725f-4d2d-8e7b-d05a733d96ae-1
00:04:02.874 --> 00:04:06.160
branded names and the database
would retrieve the whatever

2c3d1667-725f-4d2d-8e7b-d05a733d96ae-2
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.720
relevant information for it.

9065f100-f05e-4071-bf1c-2f364d56eb87-0
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.935
Is that something you do in the
existing platform? Yes, not

9065f100-f05e-4071-bf1c-2f364d56eb87-1
00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:15.610
many, but those who have it, I
love it. I mean, I just love it,

9065f100-f05e-4071-bf1c-2f364d56eb87-2
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.309
it feature and it's so saving me
so much time.

f460de9f-5fe0-480e-a748-2584d0ac3fdb-0
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.550
Fine.

20c32ef1-642b-4b97-a027-32bf33e8eb1f-0
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.630
Um, so that's good feedback.
Thank you for mentioning that.

20c32ef1-642b-4b97-a027-32bf33e8eb1f-1
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.625
And anything else on the home
page, so very good points that

20c32ef1-642b-4b97-a027-32bf33e8eb1f-2
00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:33.817
you've mentioned and completely
understandable here. What I see

20c32ef1-642b-4b97-a027-32bf33e8eb1f-3
00:04:33.817 --> 00:04:34.800
you mean, yeah.

14d35c92-4d19-40bc-bae2-fc57a4e476ad-0
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.133
Umm, OK, let let me see what,
what else advise our sales by

14d35c92-4d19-40bc-bae2-fc57a4e476ad-1
00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.776
indication. Why, why would I
have, uh, the quick links there

14d35c92-4d19-40bc-bae2-fc57a4e476ad-2
00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:46.419
that I have there is it what
once did I select it for or how

14d35c92-4d19-40bc-bae2-fc57a4e476ad-3
00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.122
are they chosen? So yeah, that's
the idea. So if you've got a

14d35c92-4d19-40bc-bae2-fc57a4e476ad-4
00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:53.288
specific data view or a
dashboard or you've searched

14d35c92-4d19-40bc-bae2-fc57a4e476ad-5
00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:57.050
something specific, the ability
to save those as a QikLink and

14d35c92-4d19-40bc-bae2-fc57a4e476ad-6
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.380
that would be completely
customizable.

4dadd9fd-c208-4601-94ce-ad037338ea5d-0
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.227
Market Explorer could also be
very cool, depending on I I

4dadd9fd-c208-4601-94ce-ad037338ea5d-1
00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:07.840
didn't like much the BI.

38df5d0f-c8bc-4a5f-ac77-8f8f626c0b55-0
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.349
Um based thing that we currently
have because it offers minimum

38df5d0f-c8bc-4a5f-ac77-8f8f626c0b55-1
00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.360
flexibility.

f75bc39c-d7b9-4c32-8d32-67a5496be713-0
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.011
Yeah. And and and and remind you
that everything that I see on

f75bc39c-d7b9-4c32-8d32-67a5496be713-1
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:23.418
screen, I want to be able to
export in a, in a, in a in a

f75bc39c-d7b9-4c32-8d32-67a5496be713-2
00:05:23.418 --> 00:05:27.119
good way, you know, So what if
you only present like like it's

f75bc39c-d7b9-4c32-8d32-67a5496be713-3
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:30.467
a little bit with the market
Explorer and with the other

f75bc39c-d7b9-4c32-8d32-67a5496be713-4
00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:33.757
dashboards. The problem is data
is good, sometimes even

f75bc39c-d7b9-4c32-8d32-67a5496be713-5
00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:35.049
filterability is good.

79b0b87a-7e5c-42ac-8fac-3827b47145f6-0
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.128
But then I don't get to the data
you know in in a way that I can

79b0b87a-7e5c-42ac-8fac-3827b47145f6-1
00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:39.730
use it well.

16fe022f-b927-4ec4-9b1b-12a2581de981-0
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.800
OK, that makes sense. Um, so
yeah, you definitely be able to.

3e4da28d-bdb5-4550-b7c6-9df676d81f69-0
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.987
Export it and that's exactly
what you plus also affect

3e4da28d-bdb5-4550-b7c6-9df676d81f69-1
00:05:48.987 --> 00:05:52.535
feature what intrinsically you
used to have in most of the

3e4da28d-bdb5-4550-b7c6-9df676d81f69-2
00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.820
parts whenever and wherever
possible.

44434503-557c-4d26-b282-743a04ac20c0-0
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.723
Uh, make it uh, possible for for
the user to edit it, to change

44434503-557c-4d26-b282-743a04ac20c0-1
00:05:59.723 --> 00:06:03.206
the time scale, to change
whatever. I mean, what makes

44434503-557c-4d26-b282-743a04ac20c0-2
00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:06.879
sense? Of course, if you change
everything, then maybe it

44434503-557c-4d26-b282-743a04ac20c0-3
00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.919
doesn't make sense, but but so
so that you can.

b9243f81-a067-49f3-ac06-b5991b8a9353-0
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.798
Like like in many of the of the
states where you can say you can

b9243f81-a067-49f3-ac06-b5991b8a9353-1
00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:20.890
change the the rate of the range
of dates or the.

f2835118-4586-4c0a-8717-e9f5d92999d0-0
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.280
What was the other thing that I
had in mind?

b8b11c13-c2a5-49c7-a3d4-9d12d14a4773-0
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.980
Makes sense?

75dd5399-f582-46f4-924b-9d44ab003d9a-0
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.474
Ohh for example, if you look at
the top ten products that you

75dd5399-f582-46f4-924b-9d44ab003d9a-1
00:06:32.474 --> 00:06:37.286
can easily say I wanna see top
15, top 20, top 50, whatever it

75dd5399-f582-46f4-924b-9d44ab003d9a-2
00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:41.715
might be. And there's another
thing which I'm complaining

75dd5399-f582-46f4-924b-9d44ab003d9a-3
00:06:41.715 --> 00:06:46.298
about for years now and it just
annoyed me this week and it

75dd5399-f582-46f4-924b-9d44ab003d9a-4
00:06:46.298 --> 00:06:50.880
annoys me very much on on on a
frequent basis. OK, what was

75dd5399-f582-46f4-924b-9d44ab003d9a-5
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.615
that? And that is if so, for
example if you look into disease

75dd5399-f582-46f4-924b-9d44ab003d9a-6
00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:57.830
like CLL kind of of leukemia.

46154e15-05f7-433d-9813-ca99694df9f9-0
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.614
And look at the top ten products
by sales then one of the

46154e15-05f7-433d-9813-ca99694df9f9-1
00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:05.342
products is IMBRUVICA, but the
problem is to improve because

46154e15-05f7-433d-9813-ca99694df9f9-2
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:09.131
marketed by AbbVie and improving
cost marketed by Johnson and

46154e15-05f7-433d-9813-ca99694df9f9-3
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:09.620
Johnson.

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-0
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.141
The rating on the product, so
it's the same API and all that,

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-1
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:19.269
right? And my view is different
you know if I ask the database

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-2
00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:23.396
what is the top ten products in
an indication then it's 10 top

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-3
00:07:23.396 --> 00:07:27.524
the top ten products that I'm
interested in and not the top 10

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-4
00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:31.520
marketeers of the same products.
You know if they're painful

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-5
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.582
thing there is that for one you
don't get the top ten because

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-6
00:07:35.582 --> 00:07:39.644
sometimes I couldn't recall one
now but there are indications

5805a4e3-0910-48e1-ba19-e8f1d144e6bb-7
00:07:39.644 --> 00:07:41.020
where where you have.

59d65503-1356-4ab7-a35a-cad444f22376-0
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.967
Several products marketed by
several companies. So you don't

59d65503-1356-4ab7-a35a-cad444f22376-1
00:07:44.967 --> 00:07:48.921
have a top ten, you have a top
six. Yeah, OK, you have the top

59d65503-1356-4ab7-a35a-cad444f22376-2
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:52.874
ten companies, but but top, top
six products and then I always

59d65503-1356-4ab7-a35a-cad444f22376-3
00:07:52.874 --> 00:07:56.702
have to export it and manually
pull the numbers together for

59d65503-1356-4ab7-a35a-cad444f22376-4
00:07:56.702 --> 00:08:00.404
the same product. The same
applies then when I go into the

59d65503-1356-4ab7-a35a-cad444f22376-5
00:08:00.404 --> 00:08:01.660
sales by indication.

99020f6c-ba4d-4ee2-a14e-19d0506f5f08-0
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.975
Then if you if if you look at
the if, I don't start out the

99020f6c-ba4d-4ee2-a14e-19d0506f5f08-1
00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:11.140
search with the indication, but
if I start with IMBRUVICA.

cee5f0f5-d1f8-4c10-8257-7ede855ea5bc-0
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.540
Then I get improved because
Salesforce CLL Johnson, Johnson

cee5f0f5-d1f8-4c10-8257-7ede855ea5bc-1
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.159
at the improved because sales
for uh whatever other leukemias

cee5f0f5-d1f8-4c10-8257-7ede855ea5bc-2
00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:25.928
they have always split by by by
the companies. Very painful for

cee5f0f5-d1f8-4c10-8257-7ede855ea5bc-3
00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:29.728
me because there's always
requires a lot of manual

cee5f0f5-d1f8-4c10-8257-7ede855ea5bc-4
00:08:29.728 --> 00:08:33.230
reshuffling of the data until it
fits nothing.

a3cb252b-adc9-4748-83bf-29234b487ff8-0
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.709
You see I I collected quite a
some uh, no that's good. This is

a3cb252b-adc9-4748-83bf-29234b487ff8-1
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:44.082
this is good. When I export
forecast data the the revenues

a3cb252b-adc9-4748-83bf-29234b487ff8-2
00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:47.640
when it when it becomes uh
figures larger than.

61e9caee-2679-4de6-a6e7-6892e3b8486a-0
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.790
1 billion.

0cceb7d6-855b-40e0-af6e-cca40dfedcb0-0
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.910
Then the semi colon or whatever
you have to to.

b2cbd819-5ac0-4bdd-a8b8-987f14805116-0
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.580
Umm.

ab7d6d7b-c87e-4b1d-8a36-4470004392c3-0
00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.661
Represent a number. Uh,
excellent. Many times doesn't uh

ab7d6d7b-c87e-4b1d-8a36-4470004392c3-1
00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:06.281
in in some exports excel doesn't
let let let me put it that way,

ab7d6d7b-c87e-4b1d-8a36-4470004392c3-2
00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:10.688
and some export. Excel doesn't
recognize the exported figures

ab7d6d7b-c87e-4b1d-8a36-4470004392c3-3
00:09:10.688 --> 00:09:11.470
as numbers.

7e6d8913-a990-44af-b675-2fed5a5b2216-0
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.617
OK, and you cannot use it really
to calculate like you do usually

7e6d8913-a990-44af-b675-2fed5a5b2216-1
00:09:16.617 --> 00:09:20.451
in in Excel in Excel. So it
should just just make sure that

7e6d8913-a990-44af-b675-2fed5a5b2216-2
00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:24.349
whatever I export is a number
and then I can that it adds up

7e6d8913-a990-44af-b675-2fed5a5b2216-3
00:09:24.349 --> 00:09:28.311
all the numbers. When I with in
Excel highlight all the cells

7e6d8913-a990-44af-b675-2fed5a5b2216-4
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:31.890
that I'm interested in that then
I want to see the sum.

a5260075-5bcd-416a-9f6c-03ec3293153c-0
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.796
OK, cool. That's fine. Um,
something that I just wanted to

a5260075-5bcd-416a-9f6c-03ec3293153c-1
00:09:36.796 --> 00:09:40.432
mention. Sorry because I know
we've had this call in for 45

a5260075-5bcd-416a-9f6c-03ec3293153c-2
00:09:40.432 --> 00:09:44.311
minutes, so we've probably got
about 1516 more minutes. Are you

a5260075-5bcd-416a-9f6c-03ec3293153c-3
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:48.009
OK for time or are you, do you
need to stop before then? No,

a5260075-5bcd-416a-9f6c-03ec3293153c-4
00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:50.070
no, actually I would be
flexible.

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-0
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.288
Yeah. OK. If we go a few minutes
over, would that be OK? No

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-1
00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:57.541
problem at all? Yeah, I don't
think we will, but should be

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-2
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:01.070
fine. Cool, cool. That's fine.
Brilliant. So what I'll show you

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-3
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.433
then is just, I'll sort of show
you the two main sections, 1

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-4
00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:07.907
being the ability to create a
report. I'll go through that one

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-5
00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:10.829
a little bit quicker just
because I know that's less

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-6
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:14.358
relevant for you. And then we'll
look at the browse experience.

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-7
00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:17.280
So they both contain data tables
which have the same

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-8
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.754
functionality, but the ability
to create a report you can kind

931f1711-f38d-4d52-9074-747c4481511a-9
00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:20.920
of.

e8e6b136-5231-44da-9df2-0cfaa4e1806d-0
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.080
Straight from the home page.

ada68045-fe2a-4a80-bc0f-6785f981a42f-0
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.666
So we'll have a selection of
report templates available. And

ada68045-fe2a-4a80-bc0f-6785f981a42f-1
00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:30.202
just forgive the small font
here. Um, I'll try zoom. Can you

ada68045-fe2a-4a80-bc0f-6785f981a42f-2
00:10:30.202 --> 00:10:33.623
see that? OK do you want to
zoom? Yeah, yeah, OK cool. But

ada68045-fe2a-4a80-bc0f-6785f981a42f-3
00:10:33.623 --> 00:10:37.275
yeah, you'll be able to search
through them. Right now we only

ada68045-fe2a-4a80-bc0f-6785f981a42f-4
00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:41.043
have 3, just for an example. You
can then see in the preview and

ada68045-fe2a-4a80-bc0f-6785f981a42f-5
00:10:41.043 --> 00:10:44.174
then let's just say for example,
if you're looking at

ada68045-fe2a-4a80-bc0f-6785f981a42f-6
00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:44.870
indications.

e10388c8-1222-4414-942b-feb618c7a688-0
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.970
Click generate report.

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-0
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.432
So we've moved away from the
sort of step one, Step 2, step

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-1
00:10:52.432 --> 00:10:56.204
three, and then you have all
your data. Some of the data is

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-2
00:10:56.204 --> 00:11:00.039
not showing because we've not
populated all of the data. And

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-3
00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:04.000
I'll just show you the sort of
the data table functionalities.

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-4
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.961
You could then add and remove
data through here, so within the

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-5
00:11:07.961 --> 00:11:11.608
manage columns. So this is
probably something you've seen

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-6
00:11:11.608 --> 00:11:15.632
when you seen the first version,
but we've improved it slightly

fedc84c1-de39-4de2-b70d-e39a60151a90-7
00:11:15.632 --> 00:11:19.090
in terms of the ability to
browse. So, um, you've got.

f7bdd3f2-64a9-41a8-aefb-4dca0190a517-0
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.292
Yes. Yeah, I think that's
something you specifically

f7bdd3f2-64a9-41a8-aefb-4dca0190a517-1
00:11:22.292 --> 00:11:26.080
mentioned, which is why I wanted
to show that 200 to keywords and

f7bdd3f2-64a9-41a8-aefb-4dca0190a517-2
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.582
you don't know exactly how you
have to define them then. OK,

f7bdd3f2-64a9-41a8-aefb-4dca0190a517-3
00:11:29.582 --> 00:11:33.083
very good. Yeah, cool. So you
could search within those, you

f7bdd3f2-64a9-41a8-aefb-4dca0190a517-4
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:35.379
could filter on selected or
unselected.

918c7c20-7b59-4a1d-83f8-d77d4adad54d-0
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.241
Which would allow for a safe
that I start with the wild card

918c7c20-7b59-4a1d-83f8-d77d4adad54d-1
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.698
and and just take the ending of
the word and yeah, well let's

918c7c20-7b59-4a1d-83f8-d77d4adad54d-2
00:11:43.698 --> 00:11:47.156
try it. A little bit logical,
let's let's try it. What do you

918c7c20-7b59-4a1d-83f8-d77d4adad54d-3
00:11:47.156 --> 00:11:48.160
want me to search?

16131e48-4680-4b9f-8adb-13e389e32f6c-0
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.220
Um.

31636201-7852-460e-ab8c-b34cf18db361-0
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.820
Star or what? What would a wild
card is? And then uh.

4fbfaf03-f674-4580-97de-f066d64846bb-0
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.875
Start. So nothing's come up for
no, no, no, no not not. Store

4fbfaf03-f674-4580-97de-f066d64846bb-1
00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:05.934
the wild card so that it says
what's before that, before the

4fbfaf03-f674-4580-97de-f066d64846bb-2
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.794
letters that I give you. Then it
should ignore if there's

4fbfaf03-f674-4580-97de-f066d64846bb-3
00:12:09.794 --> 00:12:13.720
anything before that. So what
I'm actually looking for is.

4f5f67c6-ca8f-4648-9e22-b412597ae1ad-0
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:15.900
Tunip.

04adfc20-ad3f-4ff6-aa20-6cad53cd2b69-0
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.400
How do I spell that? TI. Yep
TIN.

a25d08f3-dbf4-4a7a-b77d-f2bcea6858e8-0
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:29.188
Uh to IB exactly. I turn it. Is
that where P at the end? No B

a25d08f3-dbf4-4a7a-b77d-f2bcea6858e8-1
00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:30.270
like bravo.

7e05d0d1-2d17-46ea-8470-3ef6bc5204c5-0
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.420
Yep. OK. So that could be one of
two things. It could be that

7e05d0d1-2d17-46ea-8470-3ef6bc5204c5-1
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.440
it's not picking up the data
because the data is not there.

ce6ee893-ea08-4ce1-b0e7-183895d8f229-0
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.561
Is that is that a drug? No, it
actually my my idea is I would

ce6ee893-ea08-4ce1-b0e7-183895d8f229-1
00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:48.512
like to have maximum freedom to
search and there's uh, imatinib,

ce6ee893-ea08-4ce1-b0e7-183895d8f229-2
00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:50.340
ibrutinib or lopper rip.

a3044cf8-99f0-4d54-af10-138ce200398b-0
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.542
Osimertinib, you know, it's
there. There's hundreds of drugs

a3044cf8-99f0-4d54-af10-138ce200398b-1
00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:59.635
which have this ending because
the ending actually is a ending

a3044cf8-99f0-4d54-af10-138ce200398b-2
00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:01.390
which is giving by The Who.

e30fad69-2c05-4d61-93e3-6656a603d528-0
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.723
Ending in itself like like like
MAP for. Just choose map and all

e30fad69-2c05-4d61-93e3-6656a603d528-1
00:13:06.723 --> 00:13:10.185
all the different maps that you
have. The ending in itself

e30fad69-2c05-4d61-93e3-6656a603d528-2
00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:11.770
already defines a specific.

f26cf728-ceee-4962-959d-ad4eb2b32907-0
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.940
Type of of of drug.

fd41d52c-03d7-4556-9bd2-629b15e0565e-0
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.926
Yeah, and that would be awesome,
of course, if I could add, if I

fd41d52c-03d7-4556-9bd2-629b15e0565e-1
00:13:18.926 --> 00:13:22.471
could, uh, search for all those
drugs of that class, because

fd41d52c-03d7-4556-9bd2-629b15e0565e-2
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:24.970
sometimes that's the question
that occurs.

bf3a2499-095a-4470-8f7c-451b813ee499-0
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.513
OK, that's that's good feedback.
I'll feed that back um, once you

bf3a2499-095a-4470-8f7c-451b813ee499-1
00:13:29.513 --> 00:13:32.680
do find something. So whether
you've searched or you've um

bf3a2499-095a-4470-8f7c-451b813ee499-2
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.901
your browser. So let's just say
for example classifications

bf3a2499-095a-4470-8f7c-451b813ee499-3
00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:37.780
that's showing me that there's
31.

5cc5241c-9cfe-49d7-b9ea-295ca6bc933f-0
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.412
Um, more fields underneath that.
But let's just, I'm just going

5cc5241c-9cfe-49d7-b9ea-295ca6bc933f-1
00:13:42.412 --> 00:13:46.275
to pick a random one. Uh, yeah.
And just as you browsed over it,

5cc5241c-9cfe-49d7-b9ea-295ca6bc933f-2
00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:47.820
pharmacological class and.

8ea722d0-4172-449d-9d77-e8c45f24f90f-0
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.591
I hope you get that cleaned up.
The pharmacological class and

8ea722d0-4172-449d-9d77-e8c45f24f90f-1
00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:55.866
mechanism of action and all
that. Ohh yeah, I always have

8ea722d0-4172-449d-9d77-e8c45f24f90f-2
00:13:55.866 --> 00:13:59.367
troubles with that. No, that's
yeah, we are in the process of

8ea722d0-4172-449d-9d77-e8c45f24f90f-3
00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:02.698
populating all the data. So
anything you add will then get

8ea722d0-4172-449d-9d77-e8c45f24f90f-4
00:14:02.698 --> 00:14:06.087
added to the bottom of this
column here active columns. You

8ea722d0-4172-449d-9d77-e8c45f24f90f-5
00:14:06.087 --> 00:14:08.119
can then move these columns
around.

23ecfe57-4ff3-4a19-8278-f59cf71bb3fa-0
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.159
So you can drag and drop, let's
say for example, if you wanted

23ecfe57-4ff3-4a19-8278-f59cf71bb3fa-1
00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:15.346
to have therapeutic category to
be the first column on the left,

23ecfe57-4ff3-4a19-8278-f59cf71bb3fa-2
00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:18.386
you could just put that at the
top, um, and you could sort of

23ecfe57-4ff3-4a19-8278-f59cf71bb3fa-3
00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:21.475
add and remove as you want. So
if you wanted to remove a known

23ecfe57-4ff3-4a19-8278-f59cf71bb3fa-4
00:14:21.475 --> 00:14:24.662
mechanism of action level 4, you
could just get that, get rid of

23ecfe57-4ff3-4a19-8278-f59cf71bb3fa-5
00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:24.810
it.

574346b0-ff2d-4ad7-a139-9c29a36c0173-0
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.313
Click apply all changes again.
I'm just sort of showing you how

574346b0-ff2d-4ad7-a139-9c29a36c0173-1
00:14:29.313 --> 00:14:33.007
the data table works. Um, so if
you scroll it, depending on how

574346b0-ff2d-4ad7-a139-9c29a36c0173-2
00:14:33.007 --> 00:14:34.219
many rows you've got.

c012a872-c41e-4707-8462-6132c5b13642-0
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.485
You could. Now the top row will
always freeze, so you could

c012a872-c41e-4707-8462-6132c5b13642-1
00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:42.470
always, you could Scroll down
and you could always see that

c012a872-c41e-4707-8462-6132c5b13642-2
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.556
that row stays there. And you
could also do that horizontally

c012a872-c41e-4707-8462-6132c5b13642-3
00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:48.641
is also if you wanted to, say
for example if you're scrolling

c012a872-c41e-4707-8462-6132c5b13642-4
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:51.527
horizontally and you always
wanted to see the therapeutic

c012a872-c41e-4707-8462-6132c5b13642-5
00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:52.970
category, what you can do is.

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-0
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.279
On on each column header you
have these three dots. If you

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-1
00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:00.889
hover over it you can see that
and then you could click pin

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-2
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:04.499
column to the left. So if I've
pinned to that column to the

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-3
00:15:04.499 --> 00:15:08.169
left, so then yeah that will
always stay there. And then you

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-4
00:15:08.169 --> 00:15:11.959
could also set it and I missed
it. And I can also reshuffle. I

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-5
00:15:11.959 --> 00:15:15.449
can yeah exactly the mechanism
of action Level 3 before 1

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-6
00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:19.059
exactly. So like here exactly,
exactly got it. Go back into

43fdd691-8894-422d-8d30-5c4eddd64305-7
00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:19.300
the.

5f035694-71b5-41d2-8af3-aa75e780c919-0
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.272
And then, yeah, that's basically
shifted it around. I'll just

5f035694-71b5-41d2-8af3-aa75e780c919-1
00:15:23.272 --> 00:15:26.020
take a second to load up. But
yeah, exactly what you've just

5f035694-71b5-41d2-8af3-aa75e780c919-2
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.723
said. And then you could also
sort by ascending, descending

5f035694-71b5-41d2-8af3-aa75e780c919-3
00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:30.390
and then you could also add
filters.

193aa76a-ed2f-46c4-b061-87bc91d4d45f-0
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.348
Um, so your filters also have a
search function, but you could

193aa76a-ed2f-46c4-b061-87bc91d4d45f-1
00:15:34.348 --> 00:15:37.079
also, um, browse as well. So
that's something that we've

193aa76a-ed2f-46c4-b061-87bc91d4d45f-2
00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:37.990
added this release.

94fabc44-ce75-4525-b455-bcba6a0e02f6-0
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.763
And if you do have multiple
things, maybe you could even

94fabc44-ce75-4525-b455-bcba6a0e02f6-1
00:15:41.763 --> 00:15:44.736
like an Excel height empty
cells, because there might be

94fabc44-ce75-4525-b455-bcba6a0e02f6-2
00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.970
reason why a specific cell is
empty and maybe I don't want to

94fabc44-ce75-4525-b455-bcba6a0e02f6-3
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.169
see it for that reason.

4edae81a-e5c6-4973-a700-b5de42908fad-0
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.714
So is that something you'd like?
Yeah. But on the other hand, I I

4edae81a-e5c6-4973-a700-b5de42908fad-1
00:15:53.714 --> 00:15:56.745
say make it exportable and I
export it an excellent make it

4edae81a-e5c6-4973-a700-b5de42908fad-2
00:15:56.745 --> 00:15:59.877
there. OK, well, you can have
your own thoughts about it, but

4edae81a-e5c6-4973-a700-b5de42908fad-3
00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:03.161
I'm not sure. It's just an idea
that popped up, but I'm not sure

4edae81a-e5c6-4973-a700-b5de42908fad-4
00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:04.930
if it makes sense to make it
here.

f718c8c7-125e-4e69-a3ed-d4821db757ca-0
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.157
Yeah, no worries. I'm just
sorry. I'm just going to note

f718c8c7-125e-4e69-a3ed-d4821db757ca-1
00:16:08.157 --> 00:16:08.550
that down.

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-0
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.618
This could be because some
sometimes you know, I'm I'm only

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-1
00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:17.729
looking at data and I'm not
really exporting. Sometimes I

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-2
00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:21.001
only want to see for because
there's something very specific

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-3
00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:24.487
that I want to see. And then of
course if there's a long list of

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-4
00:16:24.487 --> 00:16:27.598
products or companies or
whatever it might be and and the

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-5
00:16:27.598 --> 00:16:30.977
the field that interests me the
most is empty then I I have to

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-6
00:16:30.977 --> 00:16:34.518
scroll and scroll and scroll and
don't get it all on one page and

9fc5c0d2-8322-4626-8569-0658d29c4fa9-7
00:16:34.518 --> 00:16:36.610
so there might be some some use
of it.

fa8bffb4-06e0-4964-acfa-8b40fecef2b0-0
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.087
Absolutely no, that's fine. That
that makes complete sense. So

fa8bffb4-06e0-4964-acfa-8b40fecef2b0-1
00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:44.189
let's just have a look at the
UM, so we've seen the text

fa8bffb4-06e0-4964-acfa-8b40fecef2b0-2
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.570
filter.

e71847e6-3242-4561-9fa8-f499364d8ff7-0
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.390
Um, let's just see if there's
any.

c9ddeb2b-b57a-4e2b-9658-ae42ff6bad71-0
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.630
I'm just going to see if I
could.

b7a28fc3-9a22-46e2-aa24-a4b0f4ebba3d-0
00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.250
Adding um some dates I could
show you the date filter.

13670609-d0e6-473f-ae0f-923eb2b3cd32-0
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.196
If not, I can show you and and
the individual reports that are

13670609-d0e6-473f-ae0f-923eb2b3cd32-1
00:17:07.196 --> 00:17:11.233
set up from scratch would would
be similar. It's just that the

13670609-d0e6-473f-ae0f-923eb2b3cd32-2
00:17:11.233 --> 00:17:15.013
template gives you the chance to
start from from something

13670609-d0e6-473f-ae0f-923eb2b3cd32-3
00:17:15.013 --> 00:17:18.793
already. Exactly, yeah, OK,
exactly what you've just said.

13670609-d0e6-473f-ae0f-923eb2b3cd32-4
00:17:18.793 --> 00:17:22.894
So if I want to add a filter on
a date, then you've got a from.

13670609-d0e6-473f-ae0f-923eb2b3cd32-5
00:17:22.894 --> 00:17:26.738
So if I click into that you'll
just select when you want to

13670609-d0e6-473f-ae0f-923eb2b3cd32-6
00:17:26.738 --> 00:17:29.750
start and select a date and then
two which is.

234a3eff-8075-486e-8070-c6a1fe9ea0c9-0
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.469
And also got some good
solutions. Sometimes there's

234a3eff-8075-486e-8070-c6a1fe9ea0c9-1
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.880
still programs where where
selecting the data can be a

234a3eff-8075-486e-8070-c6a1fe9ea0c9-2
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.590
little bit of a pain, but that's
nice.

31425974-71f9-4294-9a3c-f2696c3ddfee-0
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.513
OK, cool. Is there any other
feedback do you have on the on

31425974-71f9-4294-9a3c-f2696c3ddfee-1
00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:44.908
the filters that you've seen?
No, I think on a first glance in

31425974-71f9-4294-9a3c-f2696c3ddfee-2
00:17:44.908 --> 00:17:46.310
the lot of sense and good.

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-0
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.080
Umm, is there anything, um,
sorry, I'll just show you a

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-1
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.648
couple of other functionalities
with regards to the data table

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-2
00:17:57.648 --> 00:18:00.989
and it'd be just good to get
your overall feedback on what

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-3
00:18:00.989 --> 00:18:04.386
you've seen on the report. So
let's say for example you've,

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-4
00:18:04.386 --> 00:18:07.954
then you've taken out what you
need to, you've filtered if you

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-5
00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:11.464
want to, you're happy with that
report, then you could do you

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-6
00:18:11.464 --> 00:18:14.918
could either export it to CSV or
excel or you could save the

dd3344fc-e112-4884-ade5-df1fee9f9238-7
00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:17.920
report. So let's just click save
report, you'll see.

9ba0039b-ec52-4950-afff-d230b9b4716f-0
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.467
Little green side, I know this
is not as relevant for you, but

9ba0039b-ec52-4950-afff-d230b9b4716f-1
00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:24.668
it's just showing you the
ability to do that and then you

9ba0039b-ec52-4950-afff-d230b9b4716f-2
00:18:24.668 --> 00:18:28.255
could obviously access it there,
which is and can you already in

9ba0039b-ec52-4950-afff-d230b9b4716f-3
00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:31.677
this sandbox version exported
into Excel, can we'll export it

9ba0039b-ec52-4950-afff-d230b9b4716f-4
00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.830
and yeah, of course let's have a
look.

c1bc54d0-ff4b-488a-b00e-1837c107980d-0
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.550
To CSV or right or no Excel,
excel.

ef4da655-2fea-4d2e-90da-2b5c70b96107-0
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.639
No problem. So I'll just take a
few seconds to actually load.

ef4da655-2fea-4d2e-90da-2b5c70b96107-1
00:18:42.639 --> 00:18:45.721
Um, just it's just running a
little bit slow, but we could

ef4da655-2fea-4d2e-90da-2b5c70b96107-2
00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:48.751
definitely show you what it
looks like once you've opened

ef4da655-2fea-4d2e-90da-2b5c70b96107-3
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:49.640
that as well, so.

4330b5b1-8e2e-4045-a496-c7eabbded043-0
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.338
Let's go through that and then
what's you've also got here is

4330b5b1-8e2e-4045-a496-c7eabbded043-1
00:18:54.338 --> 00:18:57.782
this reset button. So say for
example you wanna go back to how

4330b5b1-8e2e-4045-a496-c7eabbded043-2
00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:01.062
it was, you wanna remove all
your filters, um, you want all

4330b5b1-8e2e-4045-a496-c7eabbded043-3
00:19:01.062 --> 00:19:04.286
the columns to go back to the
original position if I click

4330b5b1-8e2e-4045-a496-c7eabbded043-4
00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:06.200
reset table and you could do
that.

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-0
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.378
But how far does it reset it?
Does it reset until the start,

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-1
00:19:11.378 --> 00:19:14.955
so when it was fresh as the
template was? Exactly. Yeah,

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-2
00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:19.097
when you loaded it, yeah. OK, so
I'll just wait for this. Just an

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-3
00:19:19.097 --> 00:19:23.051
idea. Also maybe make your own
thoughts about it would be cool

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-4
00:19:23.051 --> 00:19:26.314
if you could freeze it
somewhere, you know, when it

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-5
00:19:26.314 --> 00:19:30.080
kind of filled it a bit and
shuffle around with the table a

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-6
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.159
bit and you're pretty happy with
it as is for now, but you still

2858aa98-d5f9-46a0-ae52-566d0f5c02be-7
00:19:34.159 --> 00:19:37.360
want to continue to to change
things that you can.

d9b68d85-af49-429a-8981-107bc6324e11-0
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.928
He said, and you can can restore
to an intermediate, you know,

d9b68d85-af49-429a-8981-107bc6324e11-1
00:19:40.928 --> 00:19:44.148
not not back to the original
template, actually you don't

d9b68d85-af49-429a-8981-107bc6324e11-2
00:19:44.148 --> 00:19:47.535
need to restore it and just
reload the template doesn't help

d9b68d85-af49-429a-8981-107bc6324e11-3
00:19:47.535 --> 00:19:50.867
you much. But if I halfway
through of of editing the report

d9b68d85-af49-429a-8981-107bc6324e11-4
00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:53.865
could say, OK, that's good for
now you know? And then

d9b68d85-af49-429a-8981-107bc6324e11-5
00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:57.307
afterwards maybe I do something
that I don't like, but I know

d9b68d85-af49-429a-8981-107bc6324e11-6
00:19:57.307 --> 00:19:59.640
that I can go back to the to the
already.

c016ac9c-94b9-4e0f-ba08-f35607916fb7-0
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.160
Somewhat customized version.
Yeah, absolutely, if it makes

c016ac9c-94b9-4e0f-ba08-f35607916fb7-1
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.303
sense. But no, does that makes
complete sense. So in in that

c016ac9c-94b9-4e0f-ba08-f35607916fb7-2
00:20:07.303 --> 00:20:10.652
situation, you'd basically just
want to save that report because

c016ac9c-94b9-4e0f-ba08-f35607916fb7-3
00:20:10.652 --> 00:20:13.950
once you've saved that report,
you could go back into it and it

c016ac9c-94b9-4e0f-ba08-f35607916fb7-4
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.732
will be the exact same,
absolutely. So that's I think

c016ac9c-94b9-4e0f-ba08-f35607916fb7-5
00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:19.927
what you're referring to. Is
there anything else with regards

c016ac9c-94b9-4e0f-ba08-f35607916fb7-6
00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.710
to, sorry, I'm just trying to
export it, having some.

8d37dfc3-ac19-431c-a5d6-2fc316a4c602-0
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.610
Spontaneous errors at the
minute. Let's just see if I

8d37dfc3-ac19-431c-a5d6-2fc316a4c602-1
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.180
could go back and export that
again.

de443916-0016-44f6-a713-d31cc0668043-0
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.160
And in case it won't, which
appears to be the case.

b5db2b38-d69d-421d-9e79-feaf6a6be7c6-0
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.520
Why?

b45cdbdb-ecbe-4e7b-ade0-7566fd68911f-0
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.854
Remark would be preferably that
the table would export into

b45cdbdb-ecbe-4e7b-ade0-7566fd68911f-1
00:20:57.854 --> 00:21:01.900
Excel in a in a smart way,
meaning that the headline.

c7cc3d8b-6da5-4f7b-9668-f5c8d3609c8e-0
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.950
The header is really also the
header in the Excel sheet.

c0b7f874-c652-4cc6-ad49-cb0a1f9541df-0
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.774
So not uh, average report
extracted on that day and all

c0b7f874-c652-4cc6-ad49-cb0a1f9541df-1
00:21:10.774 --> 00:21:13.960
the general information on top
of the table.

3296eb01-4217-46bb-a7ea-0a82fac2dac0-0
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.644
Because then I have to delete it
in order to be able to filter in

3296eb01-4217-46bb-a7ea-0a82fac2dac0-1
00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:22.456
Excel. I've got you. That makes
sense. So you just put that at

3296eb01-4217-46bb-a7ea-0a82fac2dac0-2
00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:26.269
the bottom. If you think, well,
it makes a lot of sense to see

3296eb01-4217-46bb-a7ea-0a82fac2dac0-3
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:30.082
when you export it and what you
export and what. Maybe some of

3296eb01-4217-46bb-a7ea-0a82fac2dac0-4
00:21:30.082 --> 00:21:33.955
the filter settings that you had
makes sense, but just just not

3296eb01-4217-46bb-a7ea-0a82fac2dac0-5
00:21:33.955 --> 00:21:35.649
on top, not above the table.

a886decc-6152-4eee-a3d4-d83b4f1c10bc-0
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.850
Which is currently for example
the case in in when you export a

a886decc-6152-4eee-a3d4-d83b4f1c10bc-1
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.340
forecast.

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-0
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.785
The you have to. Yeah. All the
general information and that the

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-1
00:21:45.785 --> 00:21:49.863
numbers are in dollars. It's all
on top, you know, and then I'll

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-2
00:21:49.863 --> 00:21:53.753
just leave it on block. And so
did I get a clean Excel table?

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-3
00:21:53.753 --> 00:21:57.203
Yeah. OK. No, I completely
understand. Can you see the

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-4
00:21:57.203 --> 00:22:01.156
export that I've done right now
seems to be right. Yeah. Yeah.

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-5
00:22:01.156 --> 00:22:05.171
Just sorry, I'm just trying to
expand some of these are just so

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-6
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:09.186
you could see. Does that seem to
be what you're after? Exactly.

c103e0bd-ac64-4e9d-af4a-8665b7705578-7
00:22:09.186 --> 00:22:11.319
Yeah. Yeah, very good. And
today?

3cc91614-dc72-465d-afb9-c23f6f1add20-0
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.214
Just remember that, you know,
this is still the 4th iteration,

3cc91614-dc72-465d-afb9-c23f6f1add20-1
00:22:15.214 --> 00:22:19.038
so we would be sort of hearing
feedback along the way. Um, But

3cc91614-dc72-465d-afb9-c23f6f1add20-2
00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:20.919
that's that's good to know, um.

706554b2-de98-4009-a80b-54bf23fd6e40-0
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:28.570
What do I have at the bottom?
The general information.

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-0
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.114
So at the moment you won't
always useful to know when you

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-1
00:22:33.114 --> 00:22:36.531
extract because after a while
things might have changed and if

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-2
00:22:36.531 --> 00:22:40.055
you don't know from when it is,
then it's hard to compare. Yeah.

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-3
00:22:40.055 --> 00:22:43.200
So at the moment we don't have
that functionality. That's

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-4
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.616
something that we're considering
on the road map. I can't give

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-5
00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:50.032
you an exact date, but that will
come in a future release. And

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-6
00:22:50.032 --> 00:22:53.286
some other providers actually
what they do, they would give

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-7
00:22:53.286 --> 00:22:56.864
you the clean cut table which is
very good because typically it's

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-8
00:22:56.864 --> 00:23:00.389
something that you want to work
with and you don't need a lot of

2a068066-bf56-49a6-a6fc-62f340cb8987-9
00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:01.040
other stuff.

b26b1e30-4ba6-412b-9cdc-47e19577bf2b-0
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.390
In the same page.

5146742a-50e3-479e-82da-48fa2c4f1e40-0
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.159
But would would create another
sheet with the general

5146742a-50e3-479e-82da-48fa2c4f1e40-1
00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:10.240
information when what was it
export and what what is it.

5146742a-50e3-479e-82da-48fa2c4f1e40-2
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.890
Maybe sometimes you get the the
filter settings.

6bf233d1-3414-4f9b-82b9-02209b38124d-0
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.771
That you applied or the report
name? That the report template

6bf233d1-3414-4f9b-82b9-02209b38124d-1
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:20.118
name that you used from your own
reports? Because maybe after a

6bf233d1-3414-4f9b-82b9-02209b38124d-2
00:23:20.118 --> 00:23:23.098
year you don't even remember
which of the templates was,

6bf233d1-3414-4f9b-82b9-02209b38124d-3
00:23:23.098 --> 00:23:23.360
yeah?

1722ad85-200f-412c-8357-0aca22931b32-0
00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.141
No, completely. I completely
understand what you're saying.

1722ad85-200f-412c-8357-0aca22931b32-1
00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:29.850
So basically, um, yeah. So some
of the, so a lot of that

1722ad85-200f-412c-8357-0aca22931b32-2
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.892
functionality we haven't built
yet. Um. But with regards to the

1722ad85-200f-412c-8357-0aca22931b32-3
00:23:32.892 --> 00:23:35.696
way the current platform works
at the point of when you're

1722ad85-200f-412c-8357-0aca22931b32-4
00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:38.500
exporting, you could alter those
variables, can't you? Um.

32bf2d30-f922-488a-b88f-dd33c6349efb-0
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.332
So yeah that the moment what we
have is the ability just to

32bf2d30-f922-488a-b88f-dd33c6349efb-1
00:23:43.332 --> 00:23:47.350
export it as it is and without
the option to sort of include

32bf2d30-f922-488a-b88f-dd33c6349efb-2
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.236
exclude nulls, um, have for
example data definitions, cell

32bf2d30-f922-488a-b88f-dd33c6349efb-3
00:23:51.236 --> 00:23:55.188
comments etcetera. So yeah,
those options will be coming in

32bf2d30-f922-488a-b88f-dd33c6349efb-4
00:23:55.188 --> 00:23:55.650
future.

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-0
00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.895
And so start, I mean, that's for
sure the most important part.

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-1
00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:04.347
Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, as
as we're building it, we're

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-2
00:24:04.347 --> 00:24:07.974
going to sort of test along the
way, uh, conscious that we've

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-3
00:24:07.974 --> 00:24:11.367
only actually got 3 minutes
left. Um, So what I'll do is,

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-4
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:14.936
um, so that's kind of the whole
create report experience and

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-5
00:24:14.936 --> 00:24:18.212
I'll show you the browse
experience. So first things to

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-6
00:24:18.212 --> 00:24:21.663
mention now is some of these
things are grayed out. That's

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-7
00:24:21.663 --> 00:24:25.056
purely because they're not
active at the minute. So right

f02d0c28-f524-41ee-a536-427ac4afdab4-8
00:24:25.056 --> 00:24:27.279
now we only have drugs and
companies.

3ba5ebb7-3e07-48d1-bb6a-9b9125bd9d57-0
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.662
So this is something that you've
not seen. This is something that

3ba5ebb7-3e07-48d1-bb6a-9b9125bd9d57-1
00:24:30.662 --> 00:24:33.010
we've done in the last couple of
iterations. Um.

d430e2c7-7b56-4562-9d27-eb6bd54185e0-0
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.956
This is essentially the browse
experience, so this is the

d430e2c7-7b56-4562-9d27-eb6bd54185e0-1
00:24:36.956 --> 00:24:40.325
overview page for drugs. Now the
idea for this page is that

d430e2c7-7b56-4562-9d27-eb6bd54185e0-2
00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:43.020
you'll have some calculated
metrics at the top.

007b8945-2eb8-4870-a365-909e27fbaa62-0
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:47.270
Um, you'll have a section for
any relevant events.

154c0f83-2998-4936-a1c3-3b8c61f7b810-0
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.056
And then you've got a section
here for your top three, so

154c0f83-2998-4936-a1c3-3b8c61f7b810-1
00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:54.231
you've got your top three MOAS,
your indications at Level 3 and

154c0f83-2998-4936-a1c3-3b8c61f7b810-2
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:55.620
your therapeutic categories.

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-0
00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.319
And then you have your overview
drugs table at the bottom. So

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-1
00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:04.173
these columns are already sort
of, um, altered for a drugs

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-2
00:25:04.173 --> 00:25:08.288
overview sort of landscape. And
this contains the same sort of

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-3
00:25:08.288 --> 00:25:12.468
data table functionalities. You
could manage your columns, add,

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-4
00:25:12.468 --> 00:25:16.387
remove, export, save. And the
point is, is that when you're

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-5
00:25:16.387 --> 00:25:19.980
filtering these calculated
metrics that the data table

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-6
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.050
below will also filter
accordingly. That's not

a162b86e-7d6c-45a9-a48c-03a8c1ab22bc-7
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.120
something that we've built at
the moment, but.

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-0
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.147
Something that's going to come
in the future. Yeah. So do you

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-1
00:25:30.147 --> 00:25:34.087
have, um, so sorry, actually let
me just before I ask for your

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-2
00:25:34.087 --> 00:25:37.589
feedback. And we've also
implemented a new thing called

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-3
00:25:37.589 --> 00:25:41.653
slices. So at the moment we only
have sales and indications, but

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-4
00:25:41.653 --> 00:25:45.593
the idea is that it's, it's a
curated view of that data. So if

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-5
00:25:45.593 --> 00:25:49.158
you go into indications that
you'll see your columns for

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-6
00:25:49.158 --> 00:25:52.847
indications will be slightly
different to your columns for

0c46c437-4d72-418a-a970-1c504490e8a8-7
00:25:52.847 --> 00:25:56.600
sales, but it's the ability for
you to sort of get a quick.

54f7678d-283b-4fe4-9054-49181f4a0d0c-0
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.650
Landscape view of that data.

d6f07634-1420-4365-86f3-7737c1e04c37-0
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.014
Yeah. So if you look into sales,
you'll see what would be

d6f07634-1420-4365-86f3-7737c1e04c37-1
00:26:03.014 --> 00:26:06.070
miscellaneous cancer versus
solid tumors, I mean.

fe73efa4-6900-45f8-9042-4c1e6d771a7a-0
00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.353
You have solid and you have
hematological tumors. And what

fe73efa4-6900-45f8-9042-4c1e6d771a7a-1
00:26:10.353 --> 00:26:14.246
is miscellaneous? Good question.
I would need to get back to you

fe73efa4-6900-45f8-9042-4c1e6d771a7a-2
00:26:14.246 --> 00:26:18.138
on that one anyway. In general,
if possible under there might be

fe73efa4-6900-45f8-9042-4c1e6d771a7a-3
00:26:18.138 --> 00:26:22.031
good good uses for the word, but
in general I hate miscellaneous

fe73efa4-6900-45f8-9042-4c1e6d771a7a-4
00:26:22.031 --> 00:26:25.624
because then it means I don't
know what I'm looking at. OK.

fe73efa4-6900-45f8-9042-4c1e6d771a7a-5
00:26:25.624 --> 00:26:28.080
No, that's I agree with you on
that one.

94c5fdd4-b370-4dc3-95d6-7232984f62a1-0
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.796
Terms in terms of this sort of
index page, this is what we're

94c5fdd4-b370-4dc3-95d6-7232984f62a1-1
00:26:32.796 --> 00:26:36.395
calling an overview index page.
Do you have any feedback on any

94c5fdd4-b370-4dc3-95d6-7232984f62a1-2
00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:39.770
of this so you've got your
metrics, customizability, so for

94c5fdd4-b370-4dc3-95d6-7232984f62a1-3
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.220
example.

a925697f-2e27-4557-acda-7594b4187daf-0
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:46.234
What is it that I'm looking at,
13 billion in 2021? It's

a925697f-2e27-4557-acda-7594b4187daf-1
00:26:46.234 --> 00:26:48.140
worldwide sales of what?

11a5554d-8965-4ecb-a2bb-c5f16847dd42-0
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.251
Um, so at the moment I could be
wrong, but I think that's drugs

11a5554d-8965-4ecb-a2bb-c5f16847dd42-1
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:53.670
across.

fdbb309f-6ddf-4ca6-ba0b-adc4d4144774-0
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.850
It's all across the world, so
it's not for a specific drug. Is

fdbb309f-6ddf-4ca6-ba0b-adc4d4144774-1
00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.510
that is that something that
you'd want to customize?

790237a3-4343-4668-abc2-a596f43ec872-0
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.341
Yeah. So, so for example, so, so
if I understand it, whether the

790237a3-4343-4668-abc2-a596f43ec872-1
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:12.604
current data is correct or not,
as I understand it, it's

790237a3-4343-4668-abc2-a596f43ec872-2
00:27:12.604 --> 00:27:16.942
basically a dashboard which
informs you about the current

790237a3-4343-4668-abc2-a596f43ec872-3
00:27:16.942 --> 00:27:21.505
state of global, the current
globe, some current global drug

790237a3-4343-4668-abc2-a596f43ec872-4
00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:23.450
information and it's fine.

b1c23b7a-ed61-4c3d-8ac1-cbee22e26429-0
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.743
Because sometimes it might be
exactly what I'm looking for,

b1c23b7a-ed61-4c3d-8ac1-cbee22e26429-1
00:27:28.743 --> 00:27:31.980
but uh, would be great again if
I could then um.

81378c8a-6bd5-4ebf-9fe9-3d7d82149b20-0
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.418
The selected technology, since
I'm typically only interested in

81378c8a-6bd5-4ebf-9fe9-3d7d82149b20-1
00:27:37.418 --> 00:27:40.706
small molecules, so maybe I
would like to see what what

81378c8a-6bd5-4ebf-9fe9-3d7d82149b20-2
00:27:40.706 --> 00:27:44.171
we're only the small molecule
global sales. Fine. So you'd

81378c8a-6bd5-4ebf-9fe9-3d7d82149b20-3
00:27:44.171 --> 00:27:47.518
wanna apply a filter to face
phase one, phase two, phase

81378c8a-6bd5-4ebf-9fe9-3d7d82149b20-4
00:27:47.518 --> 00:27:51.159
three. Of course I want to see
how much of my technologies in

81378c8a-6bd5-4ebf-9fe9-3d7d82149b20-5
00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:54.800
the pipeline and which phase and
not all the other stuff that

81378c8a-6bd5-4ebf-9fe9-3d7d82149b20-6
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.209
that that is not not my.

118ba5d8-945a-4424-acf9-2794ecbb7b4f-0
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.680
My business.

755cd088-6e9b-40c4-b4d2-2be286dc2569-0
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.488
That makes sense. So you want to
apply filters to those metrics?

755cd088-6e9b-40c4-b4d2-2be286dc2569-1
00:28:03.488 --> 00:28:06.891
Um, in order to sort of
preferably, yeah, well, and not

755cd088-6e9b-40c4-b4d2-2be286dc2569-2
00:28:06.891 --> 00:28:10.779
only filters, but also would be
great if I could choose to make

755cd088-6e9b-40c4-b4d2-2be286dc2569-3
00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:14.060
it the default that I don't have
to do it every time.

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-0
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.813
OK. Fine to choose this, that's
a that's good feedback actually.

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-1
00:28:18.813 --> 00:28:22.636
Yeah. And like I said before I
would like to wherever it makes

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-2
00:28:22.636 --> 00:28:26.216
sense. I mean you're smart
people you'll find out wherever

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-3
00:28:26.216 --> 00:28:29.492
it makes sense make it
customizable so that so so for

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-4
00:28:29.492 --> 00:28:33.497
example in the current view when
I look look up a forecast for an

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-5
00:28:33.497 --> 00:28:37.380
indication then I get a company
name, I get the drugs name, the

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-6
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.960
brand name, I get of course all
the forecast years but the

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-7
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.297
revenues and all that and
certain other uh data points

55f5cf83-fae8-46a3-8de0-186aa96ce35f-8
00:28:44.297 --> 00:28:44.540
but.

a5aa33c9-75b3-4fbc-b23a-0893a0333e75-0
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.450
For example, what what I do not
get from evaluate uh as a

a5aa33c9-75b3-4fbc-b23a-0893a0333e75-1
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.660
default. It's a generic drug
name.

e708cac9-4b6e-43c5-913f-a39cee5ca74f-0
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.233
And I live mainly in a generic
drug name world. Uh doesn't mean

e708cac9-4b6e-43c5-913f-a39cee5ca74f-1
00:28:56.233 --> 00:29:00.592
that the the brand names are not
important to me, but I also

e708cac9-4b6e-43c5-913f-a39cee5ca74f-2
00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:04.808
always in addition need the
generic name. OK, so so when I

e708cac9-4b6e-43c5-913f-a39cee5ca74f-3
00:29:04.808 --> 00:29:09.310
look, when I type in the name of
a drug and I get the forecast

e708cac9-4b6e-43c5-913f-a39cee5ca74f-4
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.669
number then then I would like to
be able to to arrange or or

e708cac9-4b6e-43c5-913f-a39cee5ca74f-5
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:14.170
define.

d7a8dd42-477b-4110-89e0-99451c5ef844-0
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.844
What are the standard, uh, data
points that this table will show

d7a8dd42-477b-4110-89e0-99451c5ef844-1
00:29:19.844 --> 00:29:23.050
me every time when I go into it,
you know?

f927adf4-fdd4-4675-98ab-9623d85ef014-0
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.610
Fine, that makes sense. Um, I'll
take a note of that as well.

74e0de80-0267-40af-9239-947b1bf7b04b-0
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.379
Are you OK for another couple of
minutes? Would that be OK or?

74e0de80-0267-40af-9239-947b1bf7b04b-1
00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:35.140
And by the way, man, I think
it's really useful.

3ce985d7-610e-41f3-b8f2-b667a206cf1d-0
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.346
I would have no problem with the
idea that we haven't set up

3ce985d7-610e-41f3-b8f2-b667a206cf1d-1
00:29:40.346 --> 00:29:43.687
another call if it makes sense
for you. Oh, brilliant. That's

3ce985d7-610e-41f3-b8f2-b667a206cf1d-2
00:29:43.687 --> 00:29:47.135
that's really good, actually. So
let me make a note of that and

3ce985d7-610e-41f3-b8f2-b667a206cf1d-3
00:29:47.135 --> 00:29:47.890
happy to do a.

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-0
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.022
Yeah. So what I'll do is I'll
once we've had this call, I'll

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-1
00:29:56.022 --> 00:29:58.856
obviously share the feedback
with the rest of the team. And

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-2
00:29:58.856 --> 00:30:01.691
then if anyone with some more
product knowledge for example

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-3
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:04.526
wants to do a bit of a deeper
dive and get your thoughts on

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-4
00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:07.314
something more specific than
yeah that would be brilliant.

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-5
00:30:07.314 --> 00:30:09.960
Thank you for that. That's
appreciated. Um, this is the

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-6
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.078
individual so drug item page, so
we saw an overview. So what I'll

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-7
00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:16.149
do is let me just show you how I
got here. If I then Scroll down

e8abd236-08a1-4ee5-9004-e5f7ecd898be-8
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:18.890
on here, you've got all of these
generic names if I then.

ae5ba116-c571-4fec-a750-b2f11ff9f80d-0
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.700
Click into each one, um again.

97152a38-771c-44ce-a808-f5e51cc3bed3-0
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.043
We've got some information about
that. So the primary branded

97152a38-771c-44ce-a808-f5e51cc3bed3-1
00:30:26.043 --> 00:30:29.558
name, status indication, launch
indication, companies with

97152a38-771c-44ce-a808-f5e51cc3bed3-2
00:30:29.558 --> 00:30:33.371
sales, some metrics and then a
data table is there. Do you have

97152a38-771c-44ce-a808-f5e51cc3bed3-3
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:34.920
any feedback on that page?

06fb4be9-259e-4ec9-ae19-282c2c687601-0
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.040
Looks good on a first glance.

7cccf87c-5b7d-4d56-97d1-e9c179aa8386-0
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.540
Is there any um?

29b26764-8769-47d9-b48a-7adcd8e3db43-0
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.931
Any specific information that
you would want there or you

29b26764-8769-47d9-b48a-7adcd8e3db43-1
00:30:51.931 --> 00:30:52.870
wouldn't want there?

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-0
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.812
Yeah, well I thought, well there
there's a possibility to manage

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-1
00:30:57.812 --> 00:31:01.138
columns. To question is can I
own and manage, can I own and

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-2
00:31:01.138 --> 00:31:04.685
manage to columns so that they
are or can I choose to see other

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-3
00:31:04.685 --> 00:31:08.177
exactly fine. And if that then
would freeze. If I can say I'll

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-4
00:31:08.177 --> 00:31:11.668
look into liquids. And I managed
to columns because very often

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-5
00:31:11.668 --> 00:31:15.105
it's really the case that I'm
after the the same kind of data

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-6
00:31:15.105 --> 00:31:18.486
for different products. If I
could manage the columns now to

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-7
00:31:18.486 --> 00:31:21.867
my likes and then freeze that
and say in the next time I log

b28e4142-deb1-494e-9636-b1cce6cbb1ad-8
00:31:21.867 --> 00:31:23.529
into another drug, that's all.

79b9fe99-d0ac-4170-af19-9ade4f2726c8-0
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:28.043
But then also how how that table
pops up then? Perfect. Ah, OK,

79b9fe99-d0ac-4170-af19-9ade4f2726c8-1
00:31:28.043 --> 00:31:31.815
fine, that's really interesting.
So you actually want to save

79b9fe99-d0ac-4170-af19-9ade4f2726c8-2
00:31:31.815 --> 00:31:32.120
your.

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-0
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.270
Reference columns, yeah, OK. So
that's like because you know I

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-1
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.768
guess and I would assume
probably also applies to the

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-2
00:31:40.768 --> 00:31:45.042
former, to your former customers
typically it's it's very similar

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-3
00:31:45.042 --> 00:31:48.864
information that you want to see
every time that you every

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-4
00:31:48.864 --> 00:31:52.944
company has their view on the
market and competitive drugs and

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-5
00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:56.636
and and probably you always
wanna have that view because

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-6
00:31:56.636 --> 00:32:00.263
these are the metrics that you
think are meaningful for

a48098de-7a1e-4cfb-8c9b-532c5b61b0ba-7
00:32:00.263 --> 00:32:02.790
whatever it is you want to
accomplish.

e262d06e-03f5-4844-a378-041bb0a1857c-0
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.447
And of course there there might
be changes and not a problem

e262d06e-03f5-4844-a378-041bb0a1857c-1
00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:10.860
because, um, obviously I can can
manage the columns.

4e95d2f8-4c72-4d93-ae42-9c5656b6c9e5-0
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:15.553
But at least if there's one view
which I need most often, then it

4e95d2f8-4c72-4d93-ae42-9c5656b6c9e5-1
00:32:15.553 --> 00:32:19.413
helps me a great deal when I can
blindly rely on I I look up a

4e95d2f8-4c72-4d93-ae42-9c5656b6c9e5-2
00:32:19.413 --> 00:32:23.212
product and wow, they're already
is my standard view with the

4e95d2f8-4c72-4d93-ae42-9c5656b6c9e5-3
00:32:23.212 --> 00:32:26.581
most often used data.
Absolutely. So at the moment you

4e95d2f8-4c72-4d93-ae42-9c5656b6c9e5-4
00:32:26.581 --> 00:32:30.319
could do that via save report.
So again, if you were to save

4e95d2f8-4c72-4d93-ae42-9c5656b6c9e5-5
00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:33.750
that report, it would save that
view exactly how it is.

8c591e29-bb7d-482e-a98d-750dcb0f953b-0
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.796
Yeah, but then then how, how
when I open it up, how how would

8c591e29-bb7d-482e-a98d-750dcb0f953b-1
00:32:37.796 --> 00:32:39.180
I change the the drug name?

aaaecec3-eaf7-4b5e-8cc6-d3d6beddecfd-0
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.812
I'm gonna have to go into the
report and change that. Yeah.

aaaecec3-eaf7-4b5e-8cc6-d3d6beddecfd-1
00:32:43.812 --> 00:32:47.426
Well then you have to edit the
report. Possible, you know, and

aaaecec3-eaf7-4b5e-8cc6-d3d6beddecfd-2
00:32:47.426 --> 00:32:51.098
and typically that's maybe how I
would do it now. But of course

aaaecec3-eaf7-4b5e-8cc6-d3d6beddecfd-3
00:32:51.098 --> 00:32:52.590
it's easier if you if you.

01929fcd-48b9-436f-9c48-25c6c925ab1b-0
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.030
Because like I said initially,
most of the times I just had in

01929fcd-48b9-436f-9c48-25c6c925ab1b-1
00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.582
the the search term in the
search and just use the same and

01929fcd-48b9-436f-9c48-25c6c925ab1b-2
00:33:00.582 --> 00:33:04.372
then already the the the landing
page where it brings me to has

01929fcd-48b9-436f-9c48-25c6c925ab1b-3
00:33:04.372 --> 00:33:07.806
to write write data in in
individualized as I need it and

01929fcd-48b9-436f-9c48-25c6c925ab1b-4
00:33:07.806 --> 00:33:09.050
I'm a very happy man.

f6bc3fbb-f27a-4ffa-93db-9e746987943c-0
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.520
OK, that's that's a good point.
Um, fine. So I think that it's

f6bc3fbb-f27a-4ffa-93db-9e746987943c-1
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.090
pretty much most of the things
that I wanted to show. In fact,

f6bc3fbb-f27a-4ffa-93db-9e746987943c-2
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.640
all of the things that I wanted
to show you.

96cf748b-34cb-444d-a592-309fca661d2a-0
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.064
I did have a another question
actually with regards to some of

96cf748b-34cb-444d-a592-309fca661d2a-1
00:33:26.064 --> 00:33:29.420
the data. Do you do you
typically use a um?

4c10f91c-14ce-4f6e-92fe-6a92233d8547-0
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.079
A mobile phone to view any data
like this? Or do you

4c10f91c-14ce-4f6e-92fe-6a92233d8547-1
00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:37.764
predominantly use a lot? OK, but
maybe that's just because I'm

4c10f91c-14ce-4f6e-92fe-6a92233d8547-2
00:33:37.764 --> 00:33:39.870
too old. Maybe it's time for me
to.

e8e36c5e-c8d7-4fea-bb86-73d69422471c-0
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.088
Be replaced? Who knows? You're
never too old. Never too old.

e8e36c5e-c8d7-4fea-bb86-73d69422471c-1
00:33:45.088 --> 00:33:45.280
Um.

efe0b623-fb7f-4da7-8c97-552aea6983f9-0
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.710
Uh, so do you only use a laptop?
Yes.

70b4d9fe-2606-49ce-9bca-5b4675dec6f3-0
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.653
You can use laptop. Cool. And
the only other thing I wanted to

70b4d9fe-2606-49ce-9bca-5b4675dec6f3-1
00:33:54.653 --> 00:33:58.666
show you actually just before we
we part ways, is I'll just

70b4d9fe-2606-49ce-9bca-5b4675dec6f3-2
00:33:58.666 --> 00:33:59.870
reshare my screen.

9dfe3477-6ad1-4d6a-a8dc-06561c3f2ab1-0
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:07.770
Is some of the sales data, just
wanted to get your views on it.

340e01f0-1422-494d-82d9-0d0e0aca02be-0
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.490
So we're just going to sales.

3a4c6def-c87f-4384-8e64-89af9d1ebe96-0
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.116
So you see some of these. So for
example if I'm just going to

3a4c6def-c87f-4384-8e64-89af9d1ebe96-1
00:34:15.116 --> 00:34:17.814
zoom in a little bit here, so
you see you've got some

3a4c6def-c87f-4384-8e64-89af9d1ebe96-2
00:34:17.814 --> 00:34:20.661
information in the sales column,
you see the the the the

3a4c6def-c87f-4384-8e64-89af9d1ebe96-3
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:23.857
information is quite small, it's
to the left hand side, but you

3a4c6def-c87f-4384-8e64-89af9d1ebe96-4
00:34:23.857 --> 00:34:27.104
can see the cell is quite large.
Well that would that affect you

3a4c6def-c87f-4384-8e64-89af9d1ebe96-5
00:34:27.104 --> 00:34:30.351
in any way? Would you want that
cell to be smaller? Is the width

3a4c6def-c87f-4384-8e64-89af9d1ebe96-6
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:31.400
of the cell an issue?

7343f23e-0daf-490c-9bba-1557e42056b9-0
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.610
It it is, uh, when?

6e27f41c-a282-402e-ba3c-5d6f2ef91b6b-0
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.170
It's uh.

d63bb19d-9123-4a1b-8665-ed19aeb05c30-0
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:44.991
Needless wasted space, yeah. And
I could see more years on on one

d63bb19d-9123-4a1b-8665-ed19aeb05c30-1
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:49.680
screen. Uh, without scrolling.
And of course I would.

dc26965a-6800-4853-9ec4-d7bd64aa6eea-0
00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.530
I would pack as much as possible
into.

b60a74e3-46aa-4e37-98d0-2d1118fd534b-0
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:55.960
Into one screen.

de1ac032-0d45-43c8-ac80-4136f998bdbc-0
00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.601
So if there's not other data in
in in table which requires more

de1ac032-0d45-43c8-ac80-4136f998bdbc-1
00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:04.271
if there's no down downwards. If
there's not downwards any

de1ac032-0d45-43c8-ac80-4136f998bdbc-2
00:35:04.271 --> 00:35:08.191
entries which will provide more
space and that's why the cells

de1ac032-0d45-43c8-ac80-4136f998bdbc-3
00:35:08.191 --> 00:35:12.048
are have that with with that
they have then no then of course

de1ac032-0d45-43c8-ac80-4136f998bdbc-4
00:35:12.048 --> 00:35:13.229
shrink it together.

fd1fc89d-2769-4a1d-bc0d-6825136a94ef-0
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.159
OK, cool. That way. That's
pretty much it. So first and

fd1fc89d-2769-4a1d-bc0d-6825136a94ef-1
00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:22.100
foremost, um.

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-0
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.142
Apologies that we've gone
slightly over. I think we

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-1
00:35:26.142 --> 00:35:29.271
started about 7-8 minutes late
and I appreciate you mentioning

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-2
00:35:29.271 --> 00:35:32.500
that you're happy to do a follow
up if necessary and that's been

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-3
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.530
really helpful for me. So I've,
I've taken lots of notes and

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-4
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.659
I've also recorded this session
as well, so if I want to refer

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-5
00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:41.639
back to it, I can. The only
other couple of things I wanted

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-6
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:44.917
to mention just before you do go
is you've actually got access to

8fd6a97e-d078-4876-b31b-b9b3c2f10f3e-7
00:35:44.917 --> 00:35:46.009
the platform yourself.

dcbefff2-1456-414d-a4ec-2f838a585299-0
00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.290
To to the sandbox version.

3bc4fbaa-c00f-40c3-a6e7-b76e856cb17c-0
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.174
Yeah, so if you if you currently
go onto the into our website,

3bc4fbaa-c00f-40c3-a6e7-b76e856cb17c-1
00:35:53.174 --> 00:35:57.045
the current live application,
what you'll see on the right

3bc4fbaa-c00f-40c3-a6e7-b76e856cb17c-2
00:35:57.045 --> 00:36:00.917
hand side of the search bar
you'll see a blue button. Yeah

3bc4fbaa-c00f-40c3-a6e7-b76e856cb17c-3
00:36:00.917 --> 00:36:05.051
that's it. So if you follow that
you've actually got access to

3bc4fbaa-c00f-40c3-a6e7-b76e856cb17c-4
00:36:05.051 --> 00:36:09.119
the platform. So what I would
suggest you do is if you have a

3bc4fbaa-c00f-40c3-a6e7-b76e856cb17c-5
00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:13.450
few minutes then click the wrong
with it and feedback absolutely.

3bc4fbaa-c00f-40c3-a6e7-b76e856cb17c-6
00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:17.060
OK. So do you know the are you
on there at the minute?

4dc718e0-569a-4ffd-ad2c-ebe823dc0596-0
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.133
Now you see the purple. You see
the little purple sort of paper

4dc718e0-569a-4ffd-ad2c-ebe823dc0596-1
00:36:22.133 --> 00:36:23.500
plane icon bottom left.

a484bfaa-b83d-446b-8c29-a26e4650513f-0
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.932
No, no, no. I'm currently
accessing the is there, yeah, in

a484bfaa-b83d-446b-8c29-a26e4650513f-1
00:36:30.932 --> 00:36:31.890
the new platform.

72849a7a-5eae-44bd-b4b4-d45e3a82cff8-0
00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.064
Yes, I see it. Yeah. So if you
could do, you could just submit

72849a7a-5eae-44bd-b4b4-d45e3a82cff8-1
00:36:36.064 --> 00:36:39.429
feedback through that. OK, cool.
Is that right? One, there's

72849a7a-5eae-44bd-b4b4-d45e3a82cff8-2
00:36:39.429 --> 00:36:41.360
another one. There is another
one.

a8c49b50-2c43-4ac4-8436-a7569032423b-0
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.242
Now that we have that in the
better version, um other other

a8c49b50-2c43-4ac4-8436-a7569032423b-1
00:36:46.242 --> 00:36:49.949
database providers would they
offer as asked analyst or

a8c49b50-2c43-4ac4-8436-a7569032423b-2
00:36:49.949 --> 00:36:53.921
whatever functionality. I also
suggested that time and time

a8c49b50-2c43-4ac4-8436-a7569032423b-3
00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:57.827
again because there's I could
have told you so many things

a8c49b50-2c43-4ac4-8436-a7569032423b-4
00:36:57.827 --> 00:37:02.130
that don't work well within the
platform over the years. But the

a8c49b50-2c43-4ac4-8436-a7569032423b-5
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:06.036
problem is there's not an easy
way that I press button say

a8c49b50-2c43-4ac4-8436-a7569032423b-6
00:37:06.036 --> 00:37:07.890
that's the problem and just.

d08cb2c1-dfff-4d14-8da5-a4964e133639-0
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:12.399
You know, go my way and find
another solution. And if I

d08cb2c1-dfff-4d14-8da5-a4964e133639-1
00:37:12.399 --> 00:37:16.799
always have to write really an
e-mail, open up the e-mail, look

d08cb2c1-dfff-4d14-8da5-a4964e133639-2
00:37:16.799 --> 00:37:18.930
who you reach out to my, to my.

ddeec60b-cae4-403a-a790-a69a9288233b-0
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:25.395
To the to the person who whoever
is taking care of our account.

ddeec60b-cae4-403a-a790-a69a9288233b-1
00:37:25.395 --> 00:37:30.061
Yeah many times I just don't do
that if I have a lot of work OK

ddeec60b-cae4-403a-a790-a69a9288233b-2
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:34.727
especially what would be needed
is what some database providers

ddeec60b-cae4-403a-a790-a69a9288233b-3
00:37:34.727 --> 00:37:39.247
have and it's excellent feature
when you when you hit the ask

ddeec60b-cae4-403a-a790-a69a9288233b-4
00:37:39.247 --> 00:37:43.694
analyst button the database
recognizes where you are in the,

ddeec60b-cae4-403a-a790-a69a9288233b-5
00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:48.141
in the in the platform. So for
example we just looked at the

ddeec60b-cae4-403a-a790-a69a9288233b-6
00:37:48.141 --> 00:37:50.620
product pixel ban link with
yeah.

fca36e1f-a873-4a09-9e74-9d0849dce5f4-0
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.960
If I would press to ask analyst
button there.

846ecc8f-306c-4360-9dd7-b52c0a561df1-0
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.863
The information would be
captured that I'm what I'm

846ecc8f-306c-4360-9dd7-b52c0a561df1-1
00:37:56.863 --> 00:38:00.768
currently seeing, that's that's
currently the product page that

846ecc8f-306c-4360-9dd7-b52c0a561df1-2
00:38:00.768 --> 00:38:04.491
I'm into. And then I don't have
to write a whole long story,

846ecc8f-306c-4360-9dd7-b52c0a561df1-3
00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:08.335
which costs me a lot of time.
Yeah, what I was doing and where

846ecc8f-306c-4360-9dd7-b52c0a561df1-4
00:38:08.335 --> 00:38:11.875
I'm stuck. But then I can
directly refer to the page that

846ecc8f-306c-4360-9dd7-b52c0a561df1-5
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:15.597
I'm currently having in front of
me and that's a very useful

846ecc8f-306c-4360-9dd7-b52c0a561df1-6
00:38:15.597 --> 00:38:16.939
service and then plus.

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-0
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.746
One of the providers is also
lightning fast and and and the

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-1
00:38:21.746 --> 00:38:25.079
people are very helpful. And I
mean I would understand if you

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-2
00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:28.467
are a little bit concerned that
too many people use it and for

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-3
00:38:28.467 --> 00:38:31.693
rubbish requests and and and and
you're flooded with stupid

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-4
00:38:31.693 --> 00:38:34.812
questions that of course I
cannot take responsibility for

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-5
00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:38.199
that. I hope that would not be
the case. Typically I don't bug

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-6
00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:41.049
people with that. I would only
use it in a hopefully

18816a0c-cc73-4a64-bb95-768731d3382c-7
00:38:41.049 --> 00:38:41.909
responsible way.

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-0
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.136
No, absolutely. I completely see
what you're saying. It's very

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-1
00:38:46.136 --> 00:38:49.300
valid. It's, it's actually a
smart, smart thing for it to

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-2
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.409
capture where you are in the
website. Um, ours is not as

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-3
00:38:52.409 --> 00:38:55.572
smart, as, as smart as that just
yet. But on the existing

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-4
00:38:55.572 --> 00:38:59.118
platform as well, we do have the
same feedback icon. It's at the

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-5
00:38:59.118 --> 00:39:02.336
bottom right of the website and
so it is a bit more of a a

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-6
00:39:02.336 --> 00:39:05.936
shorter form. So there's there's
no like big areas where you need

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-7
00:39:05.936 --> 00:39:09.154
to give feedback, um, but yeah,
you can use that to submit

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-8
00:39:09.154 --> 00:39:12.209
feedback to us as well and it's
the same way on the new

bf119685-16c3-49c4-9abb-1778af6888ac-9
00:39:12.209 --> 00:39:12.700
platform.

2d458b16-070d-46ab-8277-56e3648542e4-0
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.328
But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. But hold on. You

2d458b16-070d-46ab-8277-56e3648542e4-1
00:39:17.328 --> 00:39:20.587
know there's I'm asked for the
telephone number and it's

2d458b16-070d-46ab-8277-56e3648542e4-2
00:39:20.587 --> 00:39:23.960
mandatory you know and it's it's
it's not filled out so it

2d458b16-070d-46ab-8277-56e3648542e4-3
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.677
automatically recognizes me as a
customer. My name is filled out

2d458b16-070d-46ab-8277-56e3648542e4-4
00:39:27.677 --> 00:39:31.279
and my e-mail is right. Yeah.
And I I just hate it. I don't do

2d458b16-070d-46ab-8277-56e3648542e4-5
00:39:31.279 --> 00:39:34.652
it. I won't give you a single
extra term you know I'm I've

2d458b16-070d-46ab-8277-56e3648542e4-6
00:39:34.652 --> 00:39:38.140
been a customer for 10 years or
so and if I ask clicked the.

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-0
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.361
The FDA analyst Pop, I want to
ask my question. I don't wanna

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-1
00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:46.561
wanna uh do anything in addition
to identifying myself on

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-2
00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:49.927
identified as a customer since
I'm locked into the platform.

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-3
00:39:49.927 --> 00:39:52.962
And I'm asking to ask the
analysts button that already

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-4
00:39:52.962 --> 00:39:56.548
should identify these. No, that
makes absolute sense. So I don't

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-5
00:39:56.548 --> 00:40:00.025
think we're there yet. That is
something that will feedback to

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-6
00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:03.556
the team though, because it'll
make the feedback loop a lot and

ba1b0344-fe09-43d2-8163-24ea9837a46d-7
00:40:03.556 --> 00:40:06.149
the whole feedback process a lot
more smarter.

90a58541-9ef4-4932-8cd1-c704ffb9446c-0
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.630
And and better.

0baa02a5-5d77-4115-aec7-83798c7eba61-0
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.490
And honestly, you know, I mean
it's just really, it's like like

0baa02a5-5d77-4115-aec7-83798c7eba61-1
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.660
I say, I just don't use it then.
But I take my frustration with

0baa02a5-5d77-4115-aec7-83798c7eba61-2
00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.308
me. It's it's not that I don't
use it and say, well, no

0baa02a5-5d77-4115-aec7-83798c7eba61-3
00:40:21.308 --> 00:40:21.830
problem.

859ff381-5ade-4db4-b16d-e0d43c46cdf8-0
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.131
But no, I'm annoyed because I
said I I had a problem. I would

859ff381-5ade-4db4-b16d-e0d43c46cdf8-1
00:40:26.131 --> 00:40:29.723
have liked to raised it, raised
it, but I was not willing to

859ff381-5ade-4db4-b16d-e0d43c46cdf8-2
00:40:29.723 --> 00:40:33.433
spend extra time to fill out a
form and and now I have not not

859ff381-5ade-4db4-b16d-e0d43c46cdf8-3
00:40:33.433 --> 00:40:36.848
not found a solution for my for
my problem. And then I go

859ff381-5ade-4db4-b16d-e0d43c46cdf8-4
00:40:36.848 --> 00:40:39.440
elsewhere and that's that's my
more recent.

5f35dac6-06b2-488d-8c5d-fbceb808c48e-0
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.041
Experienced us start to go into
other solutions more often than

5f35dac6-06b2-488d-8c5d-fbceb808c48e-1
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:46.190
in in into yours.

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-0
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.982
OK, that's what I find. That's
yeah, that's something that I'll

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-1
00:40:50.982 --> 00:40:54.326
definitely feedback to the team
because that's something that we

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-2
00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:57.516
should really improve on. Um.
But I appreciate you mentioning

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-3
00:40:57.516 --> 00:41:00.757
all of that actually, because
they it's, it's really vital for

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-4
00:41:00.757 --> 00:41:04.101
us. I told you I'd be honest and
I guess, no, no, I feel I am. I

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-5
00:41:04.101 --> 00:41:07.033
love it. I love it. This is the
feedback that I need. So

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-6
00:41:07.033 --> 00:41:10.017
unfortunately, I know after
you've said all of that, when

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-7
00:41:10.017 --> 00:41:13.155
you are playing around on the
new platform, when you do fill

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-8
00:41:13.155 --> 00:41:16.396
out that survey and there will
be some preliminary information

39d40846-74a4-4e60-a62e-dbd38defe835-9
00:41:16.396 --> 00:41:17.579
that you might have to.

6c88ff39-f919-4c04-874f-ec9a02c5d86a-0
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.741
Yeah, we can look with that with
the better you know. Yeah, with

6c88ff39-f919-4c04-874f-ec9a02c5d86a-1
00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:26.919
the. Yeah, exactly. Agree to
help you with the development of

6c88ff39-f919-4c04-874f-ec9a02c5d86a-2
00:41:26.919 --> 00:41:31.166
product. That's OK no problem.
Yeah. I'm thinking more in long

6c88ff39-f919-4c04-874f-ec9a02c5d86a-3
00:41:31.166 --> 00:41:35.345
term what the existing. Yeah, of
course. Yeah. No, that makes

6c88ff39-f919-4c04-874f-ec9a02c5d86a-4
00:41:35.345 --> 00:41:39.726
sense. Cool. So, yeah, be a very
general feedback. So everything

6c88ff39-f919-4c04-874f-ec9a02c5d86a-5
00:41:39.726 --> 00:41:42.220
that you showed me today looks
good.

96b479a3-187a-4f47-93af-55e195734140-0
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.570
Yeah, I could really imagine
that that that it's becoming a

96b479a3-187a-4f47-93af-55e195734140-1
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:53.890
great platform if with the
amendments that you surely will

96b479a3-187a-4f47-93af-55e195734140-2
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:59.120
do so and and and but I wonder
or I worry more about the.

bcd91aa8-0820-4a48-b24d-0a0030fa6a03-0
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.993
The data segmentation, more you
know, the more the technical

bcd91aa8-0820-4a48-b24d-0a0030fa6a03-1
00:42:03.993 --> 00:42:07.870
part of it, not, not so much the
graphical and. Yeah, and and.

ce0a6ddc-244a-4724-aea7-e66540a9d700-0
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:14.076
Platform part but so, so for
example with your your

ce0a6ddc-244a-4724-aea7-e66540a9d700-1
00:42:14.076 --> 00:42:18.826
multitudes of mechanism of
actions with your funny way how

ce0a6ddc-244a-4724-aea7-e66540a9d700-2
00:42:18.826 --> 00:42:23.576
to define uh indications or
diseases some way sometimes so

ce0a6ddc-244a-4724-aea7-e66540a9d700-3
00:42:23.576 --> 00:42:28.648
so um and interestingly I think
I'm I think I'm I can say that

ce0a6ddc-244a-4724-aea7-e66540a9d700-4
00:42:28.648 --> 00:42:33.559
because for example if if I look
up PARP inhibitor which is.

ea40002c-579d-4a57-9bc0-b174f54fedd4-0
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.928
That's a drug that targets a
specific cancer mutation. It

ea40002c-579d-4a57-9bc0-b174f54fedd4-1
00:42:38.928 --> 00:42:42.858
works in every other database
that I use that I type in POP

ea40002c-579d-4a57-9bc0-b174f54fedd4-2
00:42:42.858 --> 00:42:47.050
inhibitor and I get all the pop
inhibitors that I would like to

ea40002c-579d-4a57-9bc0-b174f54fedd4-3
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:51.111
see and just invalid. It's so
complicated that it's part one,

ea40002c-579d-4a57-9bc0-b174f54fedd4-4
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:55.303
Part 2, part whatever. You know,
you slice it dice sometimes so

ea40002c-579d-4a57-9bc0-b174f54fedd4-5
00:42:55.303 --> 00:42:59.626
granular that that one gets lost
or that it's not easily possible

ea40002c-579d-4a57-9bc0-b174f54fedd4-6
00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:00.740
to find any term.

97251dca-96f2-488e-9129-f554836544b4-0
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:05.309
Any umbrella term that
encompasses all the drugs that

97251dca-96f2-488e-9129-f554836544b4-1
00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:09.197
I'm actually looking for, but
nothing else which is precise

97251dca-96f2-488e-9129-f554836544b4-2
00:43:09.197 --> 00:43:13.215
enough, and that's different in
other databases. I don't have

97251dca-96f2-488e-9129-f554836544b4-3
00:43:13.215 --> 00:43:14.900
that problem that I'm I'm.

3f6f223a-bca0-4762-a700-1f6960e82a4b-0
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.324
It can really be a problem
because if if I look for for

3f6f223a-bca0-4762-a700-1f6960e82a4b-1
00:43:18.324 --> 00:43:20.470
drugs with a specific mechanism
of action.

f5c5536b-4cc4-4c63-a752-f85ccfce515d-0
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.402
And I want to see how much
revenue do they generate in in

f5c5536b-4cc4-4c63-a752-f85ccfce515d-1
00:43:26.402 --> 00:43:30.519
uh in aggregate, you know how,
how large is that mechanism of

f5c5536b-4cc4-4c63-a752-f85ccfce515d-2
00:43:30.519 --> 00:43:32.180
action space so to speak.

e7ec9d74-02e4-4d4a-bc50-199526e7001d-0
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.142
And I always have a hard time,
uh in envelope to be sure that I

e7ec9d74-02e4-4d4a-bc50-199526e7001d-1
00:43:37.142 --> 00:43:41.053
I really see what I want to see
because sometimes for some

e7ec9d74-02e4-4d4a-bc50-199526e7001d-2
00:43:41.053 --> 00:43:44.632
reason because of the
segmentation and and and and in

e7ec9d74-02e4-4d4a-bc50-199526e7001d-3
00:43:44.632 --> 00:43:48.874
the back end uh, some some drugs
are not uh, uh considered they

e7ec9d74-02e4-4d4a-bc50-199526e7001d-4
00:43:48.874 --> 00:43:49.140
are.

c0a80dd2-e210-4ed6-b170-37c7d4e66551-0
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:54.501
Yeah, different bucket. Which is
why that's becoming increasingly

c0a80dd2-e210-4ed6-b170-37c7d4e66551-1
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:58.265
a problem. And I'm increasingly
insecure when I pull data or

c0a80dd2-e210-4ed6-b170-37c7d4e66551-2
00:43:58.265 --> 00:44:02.152
when I look at the screen after
I did the search, to really be

c0a80dd2-e210-4ed6-b170-37c7d4e66551-3
00:44:02.152 --> 00:44:05.977
confident that I know what I'm
looking at and to be confident

c0a80dd2-e210-4ed6-b170-37c7d4e66551-4
00:44:05.977 --> 00:44:09.309
that it's the complete
information and the way that I

c0a80dd2-e210-4ed6-b170-37c7d4e66551-5
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:11.160
would have expected to get it.

2aee2014-905b-443d-aadf-50d9c4b67fc2-0
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.162
OK. And that that that's the
problem. Because if if I lose

2aee2014-905b-443d-aadf-50d9c4b67fc2-1
00:44:16.162 --> 00:44:19.822
trust that that I that I know
what I what what I'm looking at

2aee2014-905b-443d-aadf-50d9c4b67fc2-2
00:44:19.822 --> 00:44:23.482
you know that it's complete, or
at least if it's not complete

2aee2014-905b-443d-aadf-50d9c4b67fc2-3
00:44:23.482 --> 00:44:26.906
that I know in which way is it
not completed and all. But

2aee2014-905b-443d-aadf-50d9c4b67fc2-4
00:44:26.906 --> 00:44:30.271
sometimes really it's like I
don't know exactly what I'm

2aee2014-905b-443d-aadf-50d9c4b67fc2-5
00:44:30.271 --> 00:44:32.160
looking at and that's a problem.

fc43275a-05ae-46fe-ab73-fd14bc0c22de-0
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.465
OK. No, that's that's a really
good um feedback. I'll, I'll

fc43275a-05ae-46fe-ab73-fd14bc0c22de-1
00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:39.612
pass that over to the team as
well and thank you for raising

fc43275a-05ae-46fe-ab73-fd14bc0c22de-2
00:44:39.612 --> 00:44:39.870
that.

f87d65ed-2f05-417f-8ee2-1ac768fae3f0-0
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.315
Um, So what I would suggest is,
uh yeah, if you do have a

f87d65ed-2f05-417f-8ee2-1ac768fae3f0-1
00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:47.633
playground, you sorry. A lot of
things to do will raise to the

f87d65ed-2f05-417f-8ee2-1ac768fae3f0-2
00:44:47.633 --> 00:44:49.529
team. Poor team. They will hate
me.

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-0
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.962
No, no, no, absolutely not.
Absolutely not. This is this is

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-1
00:44:53.962 --> 00:44:56.885
the sort of feedback that they
want. They we don't want

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-2
00:44:56.885 --> 00:44:59.756

brilliant it is. We want

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-3
00:44:59.756 --> 00:45:02.784
customers to tell us how to
improve it, right. We want to

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-4
00:45:02.784 --> 00:45:05.864
make life as easy as possible
for you guys. So, um, really

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-5
00:45:05.864 --> 00:45:08.996
good feedback why would suggest
is from you clicking around

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-6
00:45:08.996 --> 00:45:12.337
yourself and you know as opposed
to you seeing it on my screen,

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-7
00:45:12.337 --> 00:45:15.156
you might find a few more
things. Yeah, sure. So play

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-8
00:45:15.156 --> 00:45:18.393
around with it. Please do submit
feedback. I know what you've

38ab20b5-3add-4085-9b91-78bd9585ae63-9
00:45:18.393 --> 00:45:21.160
mentioned about the ability to
write so many things.

de16b124-76b6-4334-81eb-3becc79a7f29-0
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.661
Uh, but we would appreciate it
if you have picked up anything

de16b124-76b6-4334-81eb-3becc79a7f29-1
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:27.916
else. If you use the feedback
icon um and submit anything,

de16b124-76b6-4334-81eb-3becc79a7f29-2
00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:30.510
then it'll it'll come directly
into our inbox.

5d073077-49ae-4eaf-b2ad-9215283e8f4d-0
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:35.611
OK, I'll, I'll try. You know I
mean she said it's not not fully

5d073077-49ae-4eaf-b2ad-9215283e8f4d-1
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:40.043
populated so I'm not sure if I
will get you the, the the amount

5d073077-49ae-4eaf-b2ad-9215283e8f4d-2
00:45:40.043 --> 00:45:43.990
of data or the granularity
already. So, so that I see if

5d073077-49ae-4eaf-b2ad-9215283e8f4d-3
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:48.353
I'm missing anything or not, I
can check it out. But anyways I

5d073077-49ae-4eaf-b2ad-9215283e8f4d-4
00:45:48.353 --> 00:45:52.369
think I gave you quite a bit of
feedback already. So yeah

5d073077-49ae-4eaf-b2ad-9215283e8f4d-5
00:45:52.369 --> 00:45:56.801
absolutely because there will be
some people will be spending a

5d073077-49ae-4eaf-b2ad-9215283e8f4d-6
00:45:56.801 --> 00:45:57.840
couple of days.

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-0
00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.141
Thinking through the suggestions
and maybe incorporating them.

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-1
00:46:02.141 --> 00:46:05.153
So, yeah, absolutely. So, yeah,
I mean, even if you don't get

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-2
00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:08.117
time today, it could be any
other day. So you'll have access

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-3
00:46:08.117 --> 00:46:11.129
to the platform over the next
few weeks. And what we'll do is

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-4
00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:14.287
we're obviously doing this with
a few more customers. Once we've

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-5
00:46:14.287 --> 00:46:17.008
then looked at all of the
feedback and we've summarized

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-6
00:46:17.008 --> 00:46:20.167
it, what I'll do then do sort of
in a few weeks time, I'll reach

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-7
00:46:20.167 --> 00:46:23.130
back out just to give you a
summary of all the feedback that

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-8
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.143
we've received and our response
to that feedback. Just so you

4fc75e00-1beb-4f79-8b23-c1d4fad28c8a-9
00:46:26.143 --> 00:46:29.010
know, we could close the loop
and you're aware of sort of.

4ef1f7ae-b3e8-4248-9d77-feb1eb4d082f-0
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.879
Our next steps and how we're
going to sort of start

4ef1f7ae-b3e8-4248-9d77-feb1eb4d082f-1
00:46:30.879 --> 00:46:31.710
addressing these things.

42f221c5-0a01-466e-a69c-97f00a1f7f24-0

feedback survey and the platform

0f986df5-ba90-4424-b37c-4daddde353e4-1
00:46:41.314 --> 00:46:44.774
itself. Um, and then yeah, it's
it's completely up to yourself

0f986df5-ba90-4424-b37c-4daddde353e4-2
00:46:44.774 --> 00:46:48.124

fcf0ec8c-7f87-450c-895c-75a23fce15f5-0

drop me an e-mail as well. If
you want to discuss anything in

fcf0ec8c-7f87-450c-895c-75a23fce15f5-5

fcf0ec8c-7f87-450c-895c-75a23fce15f5-6
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.290
meeting as well.

1bb24ba0-11fe-4909-9e24-92030d8b4f9b-0
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.392
Guides that sound alright?
Sounds good. Yeah, well,

1bb24ba0-11fe-4909-9e24-92030d8b4f9b-1
00:47:22.392 --> 00:47:25.842
brilliant. Like I said, I
haven't given up on invalid and

1bb24ba0-11fe-4909-9e24-92030d8b4f9b-2
00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:29.649
I hope that will establish that
I will like the platform like I

1bb24ba0-11fe-4909-9e24-92030d8b4f9b-3
00:47:29.649 --> 00:47:31.850
did before, you know, and that
will.

98872c44-decc-42c2-bef8-79ea39458392-0
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.923
At some point be again might go
to platform where I blindly step

98872c44-decc-42c2-bef8-79ea39458392-1
00:47:35.923 --> 00:47:38.920
into and I know I can rely on
the data and be happy with it.

2de68bd5-f60c-472d-9752-c5cfbc2b8c98-0
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.455
