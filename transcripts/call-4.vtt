e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-0
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.120
Directly with the people who
build the platform. Um, so we

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-1
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.216
are involved in a lot of doing,
a lot of the customer testing.

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-2
00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:11.362
We'll collate the feedback and
then sort of pass it back to the

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-3
00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:14.558
team. So don't feel like you're
gonna offend us. Be as honest as

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-4
00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:17.605
you can please and think out
loud. So if something alarms you

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-5
00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:20.555
at first instance, don't keep
quiet about it to let us know

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-6
00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:23.553
that they're the sort of things
that we want to know. On the

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-7
00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:26.502
other hand, if something looks
really good and you know you

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-8
00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:29.304
like the progress that we've
made, but also like to know

e0968d7f-6ad8-47ec-88c8-4f5bbf9cea9b-9
00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.909
about that, so just be
completely honest, you won't.

cacae1be-608f-4bfc-8da3-16fa62267333-0
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.267
Your own offenders? Um, cool.
Without further ado, I will hand

cacae1be-608f-4bfc-8da3-16fa62267333-1
00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:39.550
it over to Magda who will take
you through the platform.

789355e6-73c6-4e91-8f5c-99e59ffa9aa8-0
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.462
Great. Thanks. Thank you. So
sorry, just before you start,

789355e6-73c6-4e91-8f5c-99e59ffa9aa8-1
00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:48.243
I'll just put my video off so
it's less distracting when

789355e6-73c6-4e91-8f5c-99e59ffa9aa8-2
00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:50.099
you're showing the platform.

4d947795-d30c-4bd4-bc5d-7cd461d347ad-0
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.279
Sure, I'll do the same on my
side because it gives me a

4d947795-d30c-4bd4-bc5d-7cd461d347ad-1
00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:54.400
little more screen space.

19600ea2-9923-4cda-b977-10b805535161-0
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.380
OK. Well, I'll follow them.

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-0
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.408
OK, perfect. So Bernard, I
understand that you've already

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-1
00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:07.592
done testing with us previously.
So um, what I'm going to do

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-2
00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:11.021
today is to show you the
differences between what

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-3
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:15.136
happened between when we when
you spoke to us last time and

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-4
00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:19.183
now. But do please do ask
questions, please raise anything

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-5
00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:23.641
that you, unless you want me to
to go through the whole thing if

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-6
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.345
you if you would like a
refresher as well up to up to

297ea30c-aa84-4bb1-b8a1-f892a42b07be-7
00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:27.620
you.

7577e0e9-ff5a-4c38-9fa1-d4c2fa5d0f4d-0
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.750
So I have to say.

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-0
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.211
Maybe a refresh is not a bad
idea and the reason I have to

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-1
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.878
say the reason for that is for
the last two months I've been so

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-2
00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:42.915
busy on other things that I
haven't actually entered

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-3
00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:46.354
evaluate, I think well twice I
think, but for very specific

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-4
00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:49.735
things rather than a general
look. Understood. OK, So what

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-5
00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:53.345
you can see here is the landing
page of our new platform. Some

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-6
00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.726
of those things are still
placeholders because platform is

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-7
00:01:56.726 --> 00:02:00.164
still under construction. But
this, this should give you an

92980a6a-d6c7-4bbc-840b-9689712ceccd-8
00:02:00.164 --> 00:02:03.030
idea what we are thinking about
in terms of what.

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-0
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.066
What would be useful for
yourself when you when you log

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-1
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:11.305
into to see so you will be able
to click through your quick

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-2
00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:15.332
links that will take you to
specific specific areas, you

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-3
00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:19.500
will have a summary of latest
news and then this is new. I

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-4
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.880
don't think this was the this
was the actual build thing last

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-5
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.190
time when you were testing. So
at the moment you are able to

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-6
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.358
already access your saved
reports that you have created in

b3537490-5e47-4df7-80a7-362aa1914df1-7
00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:33.629
this new platform.

a600cb17-cdbf-4780-a266-e3ace093cba2-0
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.570
And then whenever you are on a
different page than the landing

a600cb17-cdbf-4780-a266-e3ace093cba2-1
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.644
page, you also are going to be
able to access them through this

a600cb17-cdbf-4780-a266-e3ace093cba2-2
00:02:42.644 --> 00:02:44.300
little icon on the top OK.

c78326a9-82c3-4901-a7fb-da3a9cf35508-0
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.484
Have access to the report it
just through a different

c78326a9-82c3-4901-a7fb-da3a9cf35508-1
00:02:49.484 --> 00:02:53.487
mechanism. That was all yes,
yes. So do you find this how do

c78326a9-82c3-4901-a7fb-da3a9cf35508-2
00:02:53.487 --> 00:02:57.557
you think about? What do you
think about this? Because at the

c78326a9-82c3-4901-a7fb-da3a9cf35508-3
00:02:57.557 --> 00:03:01.101
moment when you log into
evaluate, you have to access

c78326a9-82c3-4901-a7fb-da3a9cf35508-4
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:05.039
your reports via. It takes you
to a specific page where you

c78326a9-82c3-4901-a7fb-da3a9cf35508-5
00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.680
have all of your reports.

875c3f3f-7169-4b14-b8d9-39f32bdef916-0
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.223
That that's my understanding. So
in here. Yeah. Yeah. So I think

875c3f3f-7169-4b14-b8d9-39f32bdef916-1
00:03:12.223 --> 00:03:15.904
that's fine. I think the the one
thing that I've that you've

875c3f3f-7169-4b14-b8d9-39f32bdef916-2
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:19.526
gotta have is you've got to
limit the number of reports and

875c3f3f-7169-4b14-b8d9-39f32bdef916-3
00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:23.207
just say, OK, you can Scroll
down as you've got on the news,

875c3f3f-7169-4b14-b8d9-39f32bdef916-4
00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:25.260
you have the Scroll down
because.

cd036b4d-243b-4f17-b3e0-c36a07335d0d-0
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.983
One of the things that also is
important is sometimes those

cd036b4d-243b-4f17-b3e0-c36a07335d0d-1
00:03:30.983 --> 00:03:35.385
reports need to be well. I need
to update some of these specs of

cd036b4d-243b-4f17-b3e0-c36a07335d0d-2
00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:36.130
the report.

7cddbb3e-b23e-4a64-a19c-6811dce2deb1-0
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.097
And so for instance, when I've
done a. This is just a FYI, I'm

7cddbb3e-b23e-4a64-a19c-6811dce2deb1-1
00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:46.748
really going off topic here. So
I I I have I update them once in

7cddbb3e-b23e-4a64-a19c-6811dce2deb1-2
00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:51.113
a while just to make sure that
they're still current. That's

7cddbb3e-b23e-4a64-a19c-6811dce2deb1-3
00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:51.400
all.

33a5f523-c18a-4a99-80f3-d36606d6f776-0
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.360
OK. Useful to have there. That's
a quick overview, yeah.

79fee081-2fe0-472a-9e89-4809e7a99cd5-0
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.530
Right. Well, thank you. That's
really useful feedback.

cb5f0be2-49a0-4f5d-a5eb-a132a5690d92-0
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.509
So if you wanted to add another
report to your saved reports,

cb5f0be2-49a0-4f5d-a5eb-a132a5690d92-1
00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:08.220
you can create a new one from
scratch. So let's go through

cb5f0be2-49a0-4f5d-a5eb-a132a5690d92-2
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.245
this button here and then you've
got. At the moment it's just a

cb5f0be2-49a0-4f5d-a5eb-a132a5690d92-3
00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:16.144
few starting points here, but
obviously that list is going to

cb5f0be2-49a0-4f5d-a5eb-a132a5690d92-4
00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:19.603
get longer as we build the
platform. So as an example,

cb5f0be2-49a0-4f5d-a5eb-a132a5690d92-5
00:04:19.603 --> 00:04:22.560
let's go through indications,
generate report.

560b7316-768d-4ae2-bc43-b5eeacba978c-0
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.300
And you and at the moment you
have the, um, options to um.

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-0
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.148
You've got your report on the on
the full screen as well as when

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-1
00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:38.005
you go to manage columns. You
can add or remove your columns

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-2
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:41.924
here which is also available on
the full screen. I think last

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-3
00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:45.843
time when you did testing with
us it was a smaller window. So

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-4
00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:49.699
we've made that larger to to
make sure that all of these are

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-5
00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.492
are visible. So when you're
looking at indications, are you

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-6
00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:57.411
not going, I mean you give the
opportunity of going direct to

59677763-1b70-4d28-87aa-549b6dde57a8-7
00:04:57.411 --> 00:05:00.129
the indication and just
wondering whether.

23d43037-5ad2-4c01-aafb-7f5d43b5f290-0
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.272
You had the opportunity of going
through the tree, if you will.

23d43037-5ad2-4c01-aafb-7f5d43b5f290-1
00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:08.720
That is to say, are we splitting
it by disease area?

a5dd9bc2-881f-4fed-b86d-2ddc9f916175-0
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.970
Or.

68b8895c-b35b-4f90-8ce7-eaa6ef51b36c-0
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.079
Mode of action or which other
method I I think it looks like

68b8895c-b35b-4f90-8ce7-eaa6ef51b36c-1
00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:18.350
indication but I.

aa406634-08d5-466a-b55c-e811eb32ff97-0
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.998
But there's so many indications
in in medicine that it's useful

aa406634-08d5-466a-b55c-e811eb32ff97-1
00:05:24.998 --> 00:05:31.112
to sometimes maybe try and split
them into main therapeutic areas

aa406634-08d5-466a-b55c-e811eb32ff97-2
00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:34.540
such as respiratory,
cardiovascular.

9f92a72a-ae6f-42b5-abf2-a6d6dc379021-0
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.080
Oncology and so on.

a52e2a29-d8fd-40ba-b28c-969b3d9e75a1-0
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.946
Yes. So let me just, uh, if I
understand this correctly. So

a52e2a29-d8fd-40ba-b28c-969b3d9e75a1-1
00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:47.182
this is the, umm, this is the
default, um kind of setup for

a52e2a29-d8fd-40ba-b28c-969b3d9e75a1-2
00:05:47.182 --> 00:05:51.277
this report for indications
reports. So you can see there

a52e2a29-d8fd-40ba-b28c-969b3d9e75a1-3
00:05:51.277 --> 00:05:55.231
are three levels from our
indications 33IN evaluate. So

a52e2a29-d8fd-40ba-b28c-969b3d9e75a1-4
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.538
you can go as high level As for
example, cancer or as low as

a52e2a29-d8fd-40ba-b28c-969b3d9e75a1-5
00:05:59.538 --> 00:06:03.774
breast cancer, for example,
through solid tumours, which is

a52e2a29-d8fd-40ba-b28c-969b3d9e75a1-6
00:06:03.774 --> 00:06:07.940
the indication level 2. So it's
really up to you how much.

287d216c-9575-42a0-8f54-f00330da0a1a-0
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.290
Granularity you need in your
report.

94a287fb-ec26-4354-ac9a-e5bdca3cbe9f-0
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.478
That's great. OK. No, that's
fine. That's what we have now.

94a287fb-ec26-4354-ac9a-e5bdca3cbe9f-1
00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:17.806
Right now. Yes. OK, that's fine.
OK. So it doesn't take you

94a287fb-ec26-4354-ac9a-e5bdca3cbe9f-2
00:06:17.806 --> 00:06:21.079
directly to the bottom level.
No, no, no, it doesn't. It's

94a287fb-ec26-4354-ac9a-e5bdca3cbe9f-3
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.300
it's really up to you.

459abdc5-064c-4cf9-98ac-52267dba43fc-0
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.776
So, OK, so we've got our default
columns, um. And then in those

459abdc5-064c-4cf9-98ac-52267dba43fc-1
00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:32.906
folders there are additional
data points that we can add to

459abdc5-064c-4cf9-98ac-52267dba43fc-2
00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:37.244
our report. If we search here,
that search covers all of those

459abdc5-064c-4cf9-98ac-52267dba43fc-3
00:06:37.244 --> 00:06:41.306
folders. But then also as you
expand each of them, you can

459abdc5-064c-4cf9-98ac-52267dba43fc-4
00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:45.574
search for particular things
related to drugs or companies or

459abdc5-064c-4cf9-98ac-52267dba43fc-5
00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:47.639
indications that we had those.

24376613-aee8-4a98-9613-f3d7e6b3e166-0
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.375
In. So let's go and add, let's
say market status. So then we

24376613-aee8-4a98-9613-f3d7e6b3e166-1
00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:55.790
can.

e153206c-bca2-47d4-a352-cf9c2b79be5f-0
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.850
Maybe we can have a look at.

44f7ba79-9f49-4e0c-a695-d49c5f8cdf48-0
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.090
Europe market status why not?

060651b8-bec2-48e9-835d-e06681ce692e-0
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.780
Because you did mention that you
you look at early stage

060651b8-bec2-48e9-835d-e06681ce692e-1
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.029
pipeline, we can then philtre it
further. So um, yeah. So you can

060651b8-bec2-48e9-835d-e06681ce692e-2
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:16.957
see it's at the bottom of the of
the report. That means it's

060651b8-bec2-48e9-835d-e06681ce692e-3
00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:21.078
going to be our last column in
the report. But now you can also

060651b8-bec2-48e9-835d-e06681ce692e-4
00:07:21.078 --> 00:07:25.006
drag and drop your columns to
reorder and what we've changed

060651b8-bec2-48e9-835d-e06681ce692e-5
00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:28.933
recently is for you to be able
to see where this is going to

060651b8-bec2-48e9-835d-e06681ce692e-6
00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:30.930
land by adding that that shade.

eece71ff-cfa5-4d5a-8e42-820801ee0c87-0
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.600
Kind of looking at that, it's
it's a little bit further.

eddfb3c9-6cdc-4fc0-8d38-1e758d4e5f86-0
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.720
And then you are also able to
remove your columns by clicking

eddfb3c9-6cdc-4fc0-8d38-1e758d4e5f86-1
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.979
through that red button here. So
before I hit apply changes to

eddfb3c9-6cdc-4fc0-8d38-1e758d4e5f86-2
00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:50.305
see what the report looks like,
what do you? What do you think?

eddfb3c9-6cdc-4fc0-8d38-1e758d4e5f86-3
00:07:50.305 --> 00:07:53.820
Bernard Bernard, what are your
thoughts about this?

cdc2bb98-dc10-4d30-9fde-01add0dc5232-0
00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.378
So just need a little more
information. So what you have is

cdc2bb98-dc10-4d30-9fde-01add0dc5232-1
00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:05.317
A and I'm guessing it's
somewhere below that I can't see

cdc2bb98-dc10-4d30-9fde-01add0dc5232-2
00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:08.610
right now. If you Scroll down is
the.

8193780b-3b38-4c1d-a42a-f8b34966a16b-0
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.841
There's a in the report that
also for instance the either

8193780b-3b38-4c1d-a42a-f8b34966a16b-1
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:19.529
month or year values that it's
referring to and I don't see

8193780b-3b38-4c1d-a42a-f8b34966a16b-2
00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:22.030
that on this these columns as a.

f44110db-6371-4c49-a98a-02c3ddf7d2c7-0
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.387
Output. So when you're looking
at sales, for instance, the

f44110db-6371-4c49-a98a-02c3ddf7d2c7-1
00:08:28.387 --> 00:08:32.986
report will give you all of
these, and they will concatenate

f44110db-6371-4c49-a98a-02c3ddf7d2c7-2
00:08:32.986 --> 00:08:35.550
them of course, but they're
also.

d50b6a8f-bc65-4d79-a0dc-d2fa89df300a-0
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.180
And I don't see the of the
ranges from 2021 to 26, OK.

8ba1a3b0-07c7-448b-a07e-44372f5afb95-0
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.912
Yes, apologies. I should have
mentioned that this is where you

8ba1a3b0-07c7-448b-a07e-44372f5afb95-1
00:08:45.912 --> 00:08:49.250
where you filtered, yeah.
Mm-hmm. OK. No, that's fine.

18273bfc-6885-45d8-a9a7-c7cec38905cf-0
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.059
OK. And then also you have
options to change those um to

18273bfc-6885-45d8-a9a7-c7cec38905cf-1
00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:57.690
half yearly or quarterly as well
if you want to um?

a8a48d8a-b6a9-4ef7-8c7d-7fbc167cfa27-0
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.086
Do that for your report. So
yeah, let's click apply changes

a8a48d8a-b6a9-4ef7-8c7d-7fbc167cfa27-1
00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:04.330
and just to um.

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-0
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.081
Just just wanted to highlight
that this is, this is still

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-1
00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:12.668
being built, but when we are,
uh, when we are ready to

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-2
00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:16.124
migrate, you yourself, your
colleagues and our other

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-3
00:09:16.124 --> 00:09:19.840
customers, we are going to have
the same data on the new

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-4
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.948
platform. So the user experience
is going to be completely new

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-5
00:09:23.948 --> 00:09:28.121
and transformed, but the data is
still the evaluate data. So if

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-6
00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:32.294
you see something that doesn't
look right at the moment, that's

9a1cf6ea-b94e-4846-add4-f73cf3eb6487-7
00:09:32.294 --> 00:09:35.489
only because it's under
construction, but as we.

d4b96454-d8d9-4baf-b8fa-807074bbc136-0
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.227
As we progress with the Umm
platform development, UM, I just

d4b96454-d8d9-4baf-b8fa-807074bbc136-1
00:09:39.227 --> 00:09:42.994
want to to make sure that that
you know that you know the data

d4b96454-d8d9-4baf-b8fa-807074bbc136-2
00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:44.250
is is still our data.

7ad71e69-10f3-4451-b0fc-db7661b7be80-0
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:51.985
OK, so this is our report, um,
as you can see, we have, uh,

7ad71e69-10f3-4451-b0fc-db7661b7be80-1
00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:57.528
we've got our indications here.
So you've got your level 1-2 and

7ad71e69-10f3-4451-b0fc-db7661b7be80-2
00:09:57.528 --> 00:10:01.280
three and as you mentioned, we
can, we can.

c6a801ab-a32a-4f47-8d85-4c895a7e1f57-0
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.523
We can select specific uh
specific levels. So what we have

c6a801ab-a32a-4f47-8d85-4c895a7e1f57-1
00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:12.416
recently done um is the is the
philtre options for those

c6a801ab-a32a-4f47-8d85-4c895a7e1f57-2
00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:17.909
columns. So you are able to sort
in the ascending or descending

c6a801ab-a32a-4f47-8d85-4c895a7e1f57-3
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:23.402
order and also philtre. So you
can either search for a specific

c6a801ab-a32a-4f47-8d85-4c895a7e1f57-4
00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:26.750
or in this case indication or
you can.

9ff23b77-6c02-40f9-92d0-470309eb2ab9-0
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:33.370
Select a couple, um, or both and
then apply philtres.

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-0
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.718
And it's going to, it's going to
show you on your relevant data.

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-1
00:10:38.718 --> 00:10:42.875
Another option here and as you
can see if you hover over that

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-2
00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:47.032
little 3 dot menu pops up so you
so you can then select those

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-3
00:10:47.032 --> 00:10:51.189
options. Another thing is you
can also pin your column to the

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-4
00:10:51.189 --> 00:10:55.346
left, so now you can see that
indication level one is on your

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-5
00:10:55.346 --> 00:10:59.771
left hand side, so as you scroll
your report to the right you can

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-6
00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:03.727
still see which indication this
data refers to when you're

043052b2-3288-48dc-af91-65c6c81a6e00-7
00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:04.130
doing.

91bf23d3-20dc-4461-b006-a00199e22b1b-0
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.784
Filtering. Is this great? Is it
possible to also add in like

91bf23d3-20dc-4461-b006-a00199e22b1b-1
00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:13.541
you've got the pin right? Is it
possible to also add in a symbol

91bf23d3-20dc-4461-b006-a00199e22b1b-2
00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:16.030
to say you you're filtering
this?

2cfd61e3-738b-4756-815f-031fde923541-0
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.334
Actually on the tab itself
rather than if you have the drop

2cfd61e3-738b-4756-815f-031fde923541-1
00:11:20.334 --> 00:11:22.560
down and the reason I say that
is because.

be797234-a2b2-4006-9592-8eb0f1917482-0
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.502
I know I've fallen into this
this myself, where you think,

be797234-a2b2-4006-9592-8eb0f1917482-1
00:11:28.502 --> 00:11:32.444
oh, I've got the full report,
but actually it's I filtered

be797234-a2b2-4006-9592-8eb0f1917482-2
00:11:32.444 --> 00:11:33.180
part of it.

48bea068-c59c-4695-9456-c79669ec44c2-0
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.760
Because of some other project
whatever and I didn't realise I

48bea068-c59c-4695-9456-c79669ec44c2-1
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.900
had a philtre on it.

e4d6dd0c-82df-4105-8602-e2781d83b96d-0
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.523
Ohh, you mean when you when you
have filtered a column that it

e4d6dd0c-82df-4105-8602-e2781d83b96d-1
00:11:44.523 --> 00:11:48.555
actually indicates somewhere
here that it has been filtered

e4d6dd0c-82df-4105-8602-e2781d83b96d-2
00:11:48.555 --> 00:11:49.160
filtered.

a399b301-e7b9-4b37-80fa-8f6e78173d9e-0
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.451
Just to say OK, you've you've
you put a philtre on this

a399b301-e7b9-4b37-80fa-8f6e78173d9e-1
00:11:52.451 --> 00:11:52.840
column.

df46ed4b-4906-45fd-9351-bc04c04b8391-0
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.630
Yes. OK. Yeah, I I understand.
Yeah. You did mention that you

df46ed4b-4906-45fd-9351-bc04c04b8391-1
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.339
sometimes go in and change your
programme parameters. So you

df46ed4b-4906-45fd-9351-bc04c04b8391-2
00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:04.988
want to make you, you want to
know what's what. It has been

df46ed4b-4906-45fd-9351-bc04c04b8391-3
00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:08.941
already filtered on. Understood.
Well, no, that it was filtered,

df46ed4b-4906-45fd-9351-bc04c04b8391-4
00:12:08.941 --> 00:12:12.589
not what it was filtered on.
Because I to all I want to say

df46ed4b-4906-45fd-9351-bc04c04b8391-5
00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:15.995
is let's say I've done the
report. I come back two days

df46ed4b-4906-45fd-9351-bc04c04b8391-6
00:12:15.995 --> 00:12:16.360
later.

897ee1fd-fbf6-4c46-9786-0f7df05ff5c1-0
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.155
And I say, OK, this is the
report now when I saved it, I

897ee1fd-fbf6-4c46-9786-0f7df05ff5c1-1
00:12:20.155 --> 00:12:23.510
saved it with some philtres. Now
I can't remember what those

897ee1fd-fbf6-4c46-9786-0f7df05ff5c1-2
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.610
philtres are always.

543f9a72-11b5-4af7-b00e-826b53f7aba6-0
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.757
OK well that's that's the only
reason for having indication to

543f9a72-11b5-4af7-b00e-826b53f7aba6-1
00:12:29.757 --> 00:12:32.922
say yes this is this is what
you've got but you've you've

543f9a72-11b5-4af7-b00e-826b53f7aba6-2
00:12:32.922 --> 00:12:36.414
filtered on this column and then
you can have I can have a look

543f9a72-11b5-4af7-b00e-826b53f7aba6-3
00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:39.743
and see OK well what were the
philtres that I used otherwise

543f9a72-11b5-4af7-b00e-826b53f7aba6-4
00:12:39.743 --> 00:12:42.744
what happens is I have this
report and I forget that I

543f9a72-11b5-4af7-b00e-826b53f7aba6-5
00:12:42.744 --> 00:12:45.200
filtered on it and I come up
with the wrong.

96a73676-7738-494d-a44a-00592a1455e8-0
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.570
Outcome.

c8808f1d-3e44-4134-9404-11a308fc33ac-0
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.060
Yes, understood. That's really
useful feedback. Thank you.

e3a4b8e6-6ba6-4ddc-8c6c-1049a415d777-0
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.980
Umm.

241b38b4-7aed-48fa-86aa-e9a72251132c-0
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.043
OK. So we have shown you what's
the, UM, what are the options of

241b38b4-7aed-48fa-86aa-e9a72251132c-1
00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:02.513
filtering text fields. So let's
go to a numerical field. So

241b38b4-7aed-48fa-86aa-e9a72251132c-2
00:13:02.513 --> 00:13:06.910
let's, let's have a look at
sales. Can I philtre on sales?

7b6bd714-79dc-4a84-bb17-19e9f15c5afc-0
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.120
Let's try another one.

c07a019e-f9b2-4953-87b7-8d1e3acd528f-0
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.470
Sales are indeed.

935e9bc2-d109-4f96-8c79-8d239742d2ab-0
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:22.197
Looks like a little. Let me just
add something in here so I could

935e9bc2-d109-4f96-8c79-8d239742d2ab-1
00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.200
show you how we can um.

9816e62f-66cf-4f9e-892b-b50e11ac8079-0
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.680
How we can potentially philtre
on numbers.

bd64400e-6b0b-4982-9c03-94b0a3e06f7d-0
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.560
Um, let's let's do couple.

aafa6d54-113e-48b7-83a0-169d99750bba-0
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.903
I'm sorry, I think apologies. I
think I need to refresh this. It

aafa6d54-113e-48b7-83a0-169d99750bba-1
00:13:42.903 --> 00:13:45.790
doesn't look like it's it's
responding correctly.

26e4d224-8de3-47a8-89ed-2388570ad815-0
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.460
Let's try again.

04e90d00-2bc3-4826-aba6-4e92ba75223d-0
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.150
Count.

e0e109b3-9e3f-431b-9ef8-33bac1e522fd-0
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.660
Well, there you go. Let's add a
couple.

8bdb9535-b025-4612-8e1c-20d83dc252a3-0
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.992
And then also a date field
because these philtres are also

8bdb9535-b025-4612-8e1c-20d83dc252a3-1
00:14:02.992 --> 00:14:03.740
different.

9d3f6a51-4614-4672-b0d3-53162e435a41-0
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.370
OK, apply changes.

73473115-6ce7-4856-a63a-19e2ed09b137-0
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.520
All right, so now.

8fc8c083-6863-49d2-8e3d-dfa2f4574bb3-0
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.900
Let's go to the right um.

f4aa57df-6bf0-4c5d-8681-328201c00f1a-0
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:25.165
OK, so we've got our launch
date, so obviously same um, same

f4aa57df-6bf0-4c5d-8681-328201c00f1a-1
00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:29.571
principle as sending the
sending, sorting um. And then

f4aa57df-6bf0-4c5d-8681-328201c00f1a-2
00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:34.537
also with dates you can select a
specific range or a starting

f4aa57df-6bf0-4c5d-8681-328201c00f1a-3
00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:38.862
point or a finish points as
well. So that's kind of a

f4aa57df-6bf0-4c5d-8681-328201c00f1a-4
00:14:38.862 --> 00:14:43.668
replication of what you are able
to use to do with the date

f4aa57df-6bf0-4c5d-8681-328201c00f1a-5
00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:44.950
fields in Excel.

933faf0e-7cdf-4719-9bcc-382dd7aa9dde-0
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.840
And then with the counts.

d066f156-600a-4264-9bc0-2ea3989f9beb-0
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.301
The same thing with the umm with
ordering and then also you are

d066f156-600a-4264-9bc0-2ea3989f9beb-1
00:14:54.301 --> 00:14:58.812
able to select it to philtre for
specific values in the specific

d066f156-600a-4264-9bc0-2ea3989f9beb-2
00:14:58.812 --> 00:15:03.046
range, something that's less
than whatever and then equal to

d066f156-600a-4264-9bc0-2ea3989f9beb-3
00:15:03.046 --> 00:15:06.100
and greater than. So different
options for.

16cdc784-1966-4b26-a736-3e77ee3792d2-0
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.175
For your numerical fields here
as well. Um, So what do you

16cdc784-1966-4b26-a736-3e77ee3792d2-1
00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:12.750
think, Bernard? Do you think
this is useful?

68f1b385-70d3-47fd-96de-6ba80cc9dc3c-0
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.372
Yes, because you can get rid.
OK, give a quick question to

68f1b385-70d3-47fd-96de-6ba80cc9dc3c-1
00:15:18.372 --> 00:15:22.168
make sure it's useful. Will it
you're filtering that out, but

68f1b385-70d3-47fd-96de-6ba80cc9dc3c-2
00:15:22.168 --> 00:15:25.842
will you? If it's sales for
instance, would you get a total

68f1b385-70d3-47fd-96de-6ba80cc9dc3c-3
00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:26.700
of everything?

91eb6dcf-4797-45d1-8a9d-c27299902b35-0
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:33.133
Or would you just get the total
of what you see? That is to say,

91eb6dcf-4797-45d1-8a9d-c27299902b35-1
00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:38.660
let's say there are 20 rows. 10
rows are below 1000, let's say.

35ce89c7-55e6-4575-ae3b-a44c7458f25a-0
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.028
So that's 10,000 and the rest of
them is adds up to a significant

35ce89c7-55e6-4575-ae3b-a44c7458f25a-1
00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:49.599
number. Would you get the total
number or just the filtered

35ce89c7-55e6-4575-ae3b-a44c7458f25a-2
00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:50.590
number total?

11c05af3-0705-4304-a30e-ad49e454dfeb-0
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:56.514
So when you are filtering for
example, let's pretend these are

11c05af3-0705-4304-a30e-ad49e454dfeb-1
00:15:56.514 --> 00:16:01.205
sales. So if you philtre on
specific, I don't know, let's

11c05af3-0705-4304-a30e-ad49e454dfeb-2
00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:05.330
say less than less than 10,
let's just type it in.

c24fc9ff-bc29-4074-a85a-c805de5877be-0
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.650
Let's less than 10.

2af93250-badc-4473-a12e-1d49777af0c7-0
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.942
Because we have one which is 12.
That's why it's just easier to

2af93250-badc-4473-a12e-1d49777af0c7-1
00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:13.150
see.

5648adb0-dd95-4ad0-904b-d117d63b2575-0
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.597
Yes. So you you've got your
individual um values here and

5648adb0-dd95-4ad0-904b-d117d63b2575-1
00:16:17.597 --> 00:16:21.819
then the total which we haven't
built yet. It will only apply to

5648adb0-dd95-4ad0-904b-d117d63b2575-2
00:16:21.819 --> 00:16:25.911
whatever the report is showing
like it does at the moment with

5648adb0-dd95-4ad0-904b-d117d63b2575-3
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:27.600
evaluate current platform.

0f6271bb-f1a6-469b-9b77-527b324b2ebc-0
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.940
OK, so once you're happy with
your report you can you have an

0f6271bb-f1a6-469b-9b77-527b324b2ebc-1
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.672
option here Bernard to either
save it and it will be visible

0f6271bb-f1a6-469b-9b77-527b324b2ebc-2
00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:45.327
on your list on your landing
page or also available through

0f6271bb-f1a6-469b-9b77-527b324b2ebc-3
00:16:45.327 --> 00:16:49.672
this button and then you can
also currently export your

0f6271bb-f1a6-469b-9b77-527b324b2ebc-4
00:16:49.672 --> 00:16:52.000
report into CSV or Excel file.

661ec47e-592f-4ab8-9c65-7235078405da-0
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.336
And the report when you first
sign, say, I guess it will allow

661ec47e-592f-4ab8-9c65-7235078405da-1
00:16:57.336 --> 00:17:00.979
you to modify. If it's an
existing report, either keep it

661ec47e-592f-4ab8-9c65-7235078405da-2
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:03.680
as the existing report or modify
the name.

bc7f7d00-ddb5-4e35-ab41-8b90236f1a47-0
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.375
That's coming up. So at the
moment the the name is the date

bc7f7d00-ddb5-4e35-ab41-8b90236f1a47-1
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:13.941
and also the your starting point
which shows indications earlier

bc7f7d00-ddb5-4e35-ab41-8b90236f1a47-2
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:18.367
and then in future you will be
able to to rename them as well,

bc7f7d00-ddb5-4e35-ab41-8b90236f1a47-3
00:17:18.367 --> 00:17:18.929
OK, yes.

73f4bc25-c0a4-4821-a805-1af286301992-0
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.070
Cool. OK, so that's.

a7767547-29a2-403e-8654-37cf4055761c-0
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:29.736
That's everything when it comes
to reports. Um, let me go to a

a7767547-29a2-403e-8654-37cf4055761c-1
00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:34.662
drugs page through the through
the menu here. All of these are

a7767547-29a2-403e-8654-37cf4055761c-2
00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:39.823
placeholders, but it should give
you an idea what we are thinking

a7767547-29a2-403e-8654-37cf4055761c-3
00:17:39.823 --> 00:17:44.202
in terms of grouping our data

a7767547-29a2-403e-8654-37cf4055761c-5
00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:50.379
drugs. So you have the.

2cf8e90e-838e-4833-9405-08f12b491388-0
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.723
Basic KPIs, high level KPIs at
the top of the page which shows

2cf8e90e-838e-4833-9405-08f12b491388-1
00:17:56.723 --> 00:18:01.973
you what the market currently
looks like, range for your for

2cf8e90e-838e-4833-9405-08f12b491388-2
00:18:01.973 --> 00:18:07.224
our consensus forecast and and
latest reported here and then

2cf8e90e-838e-4833-9405-08f12b491388-3
00:18:07.224 --> 00:18:12.303
number of products within
evaluate universe by development

2cf8e90e-838e-4833-9405-08f12b491388-4
00:18:12.303 --> 00:18:12.820
stage.

33ecf723-e081-4524-94d9-7b6cf82c3e0d-0
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.793
Then these are the UM
placeholders at the moment, but

33ecf723-e081-4524-94d9-7b6cf82c3e0d-1
00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:22.473
um, these would be the umm the
most relevant, the the most

33ecf723-e081-4524-94d9-7b6cf82c3e0d-2
00:18:22.473 --> 00:18:26.440
recent events and then a list of
your top top um.

62314d6b-45da-460d-afd3-bf1e8026c6f0-0
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.488
How was the word
classifications, um MOA

62314d6b-45da-460d-afd3-bf1e8026c6f0-1
00:18:30.488 --> 00:18:34.916
indication, the umm, the the
most granular level that we have

62314d6b-45da-460d-afd3-bf1e8026c6f0-2
00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:39.130
and then therapeutic category
and then the also number of.

ff95adcf-dde4-4835-8dbf-b445743fe880-0
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.040
Of products per.

ad915993-ef8c-47f7-a425-e3c945dbb925-0
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.250
Specific classification.

8e9ced8f-c3b7-48b9-a9a2-37f57bc71073-0
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.700
Question, can I take you back
just a little bit and that is

8e9ced8f-c3b7-48b9-a9a2-37f57bc71073-1
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.480
for the selection of drugs,
where do you, you've got it

8e9ced8f-c3b7-48b9-a9a2-37f57bc71073-2
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.530
initiated with the initial
selection, where do you do that?

643881fc-cde7-4ec9-9abc-3d34b4e91886-0
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.913
This is no unless this covers
everything. Hmm. Yes. So that's

643881fc-cde7-4ec9-9abc-3d34b4e91886-1
00:19:04.913 --> 00:19:10.881
this is, yeah, this is the very
top level for all drugs all over

643881fc-cde7-4ec9-9abc-3d34b4e91886-2
00:19:10.881 --> 00:19:11.800
the world.

ae2f9768-c85c-48db-a905-dd8cc8528b23-0
00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.067
Yes. Well, not all, all, all
over the evaluate, evaluate.

ae2f9768-c85c-48db-a905-dd8cc8528b23-1
00:19:16.067 --> 00:19:17.270
Well done. Yes, yes.

ab2df181-db07-4427-a0ae-831f7e1ec680-0
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:23.225
Yes. And then the idea of the UM
of this platform is going to be

ab2df181-db07-4427-a0ae-831f7e1ec680-1
00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:27.571
is that you, you will be able to
click through, click through

ab2df181-db07-4427-a0ae-831f7e1ec680-2
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:32.127
those and they will take you to
more and more granular analysis.

ab2df181-db07-4427-a0ae-831f7e1ec680-3
00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:36.473
So you will be then able to see
just phase one drugs and then

ab2df181-db07-4427-a0ae-831f7e1ec680-4
00:19:36.473 --> 00:19:40.748
the relevant KPIs uh will also
be only for whatever you have

ab2df181-db07-4427-a0ae-831f7e1ec680-5
00:19:40.748 --> 00:19:41.869
clicked through.

5c6a1446-fa8b-4494-9336-34e46a5983c9-0
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.165
If that makes sense. So at the
bottom here we have um, we have

5c6a1446-fa8b-4494-9336-34e46a5983c9-1
00:19:47.165 --> 00:19:51.010
added a report as well and as
you can see, this is the.

16e9a646-f7a7-44d9-9b9e-eba9c1d9634f-0
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.330
This is the hyperlink that takes
you to.

1ad002a6-51af-494e-9502-5e919d5b9f4b-0
00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.834
A drug item page for a generic
name here that we have and then

1ad002a6-51af-494e-9502-5e919d5b9f4b-1
00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:06.382
also you can see what's the kind
of the the top information here,

1ad002a6-51af-494e-9502-5e919d5b9f4b-2
00:20:06.382 --> 00:20:11.592
which companies first launch um,
the branded name as well and

1ad002a6-51af-494e-9502-5e919d5b9f4b-3
00:20:11.592 --> 00:20:13.610
then some KPIs and your.

8529ab87-6366-415a-8f0e-ca11c59d99fd-0
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.925
Your embedded report that you
are also able to either export,

8529ab87-6366-415a-8f0e-ca11c59d99fd-1
00:20:19.925 --> 00:20:23.340
save or edit as well if you
prefer to do so.

b722d1b9-e07f-4a74-a8c0-05bd0a09b228-0
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.260
So would that be useful?

91d2a718-b825-4ef7-aff1-ccc4cb87aa51-0
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.760
Yeah, that's a nice shortcut.

d04797dd-9a13-42ce-94e8-24c5a9814bfa-0
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:36.186
Ohh great. Thank you. Um. OK, so
on the left hand side we also

d04797dd-9a13-42ce-94e8-24c5a9814bfa-1
00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:36.780
have um.

0547baa9-ddfd-40c5-9a88-dc271493037a-0
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.755
Sales. So um at the moment we've
got ohh actually let me go back

0547baa9-ddfd-40c5-9a88-dc271493037a-1
00:20:42.755 --> 00:20:45.400
to can I actually can I yes go
back.

45c8f358-5924-4e32-b5e2-496e8ab2bc8c-0
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:52.310
So this is by generic name
basically, right?

6548a1bb-a2b2-4910-864c-5c122762ab25-0
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.590
Do you have the same by?

738e13ac-e43c-4f1a-804f-e7dbdab2f6ca-0
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.890
Mode of action.

962aef2c-6f5c-4698-8520-68177192688c-0
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.620
Because in in farmer you know we
have.

464c7954-c208-4f61-b0af-971f6dd93a30-0
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.020
Um.

284b6684-4bc7-4f5b-ab67-4b1a57affb37-0
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.460
Many, maybe 10 or 15.

c3d7ea63-735f-48ed-8070-6d908f0e91ad-0
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.940
Generic named including brand
name.

ec8b9af6-2b35-46e7-85c1-84ac8b01df5a-0
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.477
Products but the but they're all
a little different but they're

ec8b9af6-2b35-46e7-85c1-84ac8b01df5a-1
00:21:20.477 --> 00:21:22.590
all let's say EGFR inhibitors.

d9eb228d-cecb-4baa-871e-d923a9823f37-0
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.227
Hmm. And I just wondered whether
you go up to doing this, but

d9eb228d-cecb-4baa-871e-d923a9823f37-1
00:21:28.227 --> 00:21:28.620
over.

8d1dfd35-ec20-46eb-bab3-7a8bb7206fda-0
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.180
The.

628b90ae-dfde-4412-bcaf-1f4fd13f6087-0
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.890
MOA.

f81af20c-7e40-4d07-8b94-03a225fe4bff-0
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:34.580
Level.

35403ea6-eced-42f6-87af-88beacca7116-0
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.911
Yes, so the index pages or for
uh for different classifications

35403ea6-eced-42f6-87af-88beacca7116-1
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:43.758
are still under construction.
But it's really useful feedback

35403ea6-eced-42f6-87af-88beacca7116-2
00:21:43.758 --> 00:21:47.854
to know that MOA for example the
mechanism of action is something

35403ea6-eced-42f6-87af-88beacca7116-3
00:21:47.854 --> 00:21:51.639
that Bernard you would like to
see as a as a separate tab as

35403ea6-eced-42f6-87af-88beacca7116-4
00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:51.950
well.

58386324-3dc6-40d1-a689-c7e149e5f81e-0
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.660
Right.

8ae85d83-33ef-4f2d-a970-b87946407f36-0
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.888
OK. Well I think, I think that's
everything I wanted to show you

8ae85d83-33ef-4f2d-a970-b87946407f36-1
00:22:01.888 --> 00:22:05.932
today. Um, we are still
developing. So just wanted to

8ae85d83-33ef-4f2d-a970-b87946407f36-2
00:22:05.932 --> 00:22:10.351
run one thing past you and ask
if you, if we were thinking

8ae85d83-33ef-4f2d-a970-b87946407f36-3
00:22:10.351 --> 00:22:14.995
about adding a chart to any of
the pages, drugs, drug summary

8ae85d83-33ef-4f2d-a970-b87946407f36-4
00:22:14.995 --> 00:22:19.789
page or MOA like you say, like
you said Bernard would you would

8ae85d83-33ef-4f2d-a970-b87946407f36-5
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:23.983
you expect and would it be
useful for yourself to see a

8ae85d83-33ef-4f2d-a970-b87946407f36-6
00:22:23.983 --> 00:22:26.530
chart here as well, so
certainly.

020dbc68-661b-4fad-99a9-ee87649cd024-0
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.754
I think whenever you're talking
about sales, it's always useful

020dbc68-661b-4fad-99a9-ee87649cd024-1
00:22:29.754 --> 00:22:32.260
to have a chart because it's
just a visual impact.

716156e5-0242-496c-b1e7-2792911db6cd-0
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:40.840
OK. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. I
think then if you're looking at.

b690970a-dcba-492e-a939-3c09480af879-0
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.740
Products or generics. Sometimes
what you can see is number of

b690970a-dcba-492e-a939-3c09480af879-1
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.660
products in the field. Now this
is a little more.

1ca76efb-8af0-46d0-b9bb-de19f78baa22-0
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.760
Uh, let's see.

596ab31a-dd0b-4c19-a73c-48198c6da28e-0
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.620
If you can do this this same
sales graph.

cbd6c6d4-9252-4b1b-b841-988cb0d3235b-0
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.840
But split by.

2448b2be-b4ef-4a87-9b2c-637496500ef7-0
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.836
And and you can't do it for all
drugs because it's it's it's not

2448b2be-b4ef-4a87-9b2c-637496500ef7-1
00:23:07.836 --> 00:23:12.244
ridiculous, but if you, if you
have it, let's say in a specific

2448b2be-b4ef-4a87-9b2c-637496500ef7-2
00:23:12.244 --> 00:23:12.519
MOA.

a5bd1eeb-3960-4d91-8f60-531672bbcf01-0
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.880
You can then split it by the
different constituent drugs.

a1e88ef0-dbfa-4f8e-8841-663f6d87ece3-0
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.516
In a new way, for instance, you
can't. And if you if you're

a1e88ef0-dbfa-4f8e-8841-663f6d87ece3-1
00:23:22.516 --> 00:23:26.060
going to all drugs, what you
might be able to do and.

edbd2b33-33e0-403e-b30f-5cb36ed20dd5-0
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.661
Is say, OK, all drugs, but this
is in the different therapeutic

edbd2b33-33e0-403e-b30f-5cb36ed20dd5-1
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:35.426
areas. So in oncology in
cardiovascular I mean and then

edbd2b33-33e0-403e-b30f-5cb36ed20dd5-2
00:23:35.426 --> 00:23:37.510
but you've got to take the top.

a2390f00-c41d-43a2-85a7-9814ffecb344-0
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.898
Let's say 5 or something like
that and the rest of it's just

a2390f00-c41d-43a2-85a7-9814ffecb344-1
00:23:41.898 --> 00:23:45.200
other. Otherwise it becomes an
impossible ridiculous.

cc117b40-3954-48e3-b5e0-c5b4a63f94d4-0
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.158
Right, but I would yes, I'm, I'm
not by the way, I'm not

cc117b40-3954-48e3-b5e0-c5b4a63f94d4-1
00:23:49.158 --> 00:23:52.660
suggesting that at the moment,
but certainly when you take it.

32fe9b83-9b67-4613-a003-36eef5918708-0
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.005
When you take it down a couple
of levels it's always useful to

32fe9b83-9b67-4613-a003-36eef5918708-1
00:23:58.005 --> 00:24:01.655
see, OK I've I've got in two
MOAS here which happened to

32fe9b83-9b67-4613-a003-36eef5918708-2
00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:05.562
work. So in cardiovascular you
may have an ACE inhibitor and

32fe9b83-9b67-4613-a003-36eef5918708-3
00:24:05.562 --> 00:24:09.597
and beta blockers and you may
want to look at the two together

32fe9b83-9b67-4613-a003-36eef5918708-4
00:24:09.597 --> 00:24:13.760
because they both have the same
or similar indications, slightly

32fe9b83-9b67-4613-a003-36eef5918708-5
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.860
different but similar and they
sort of compete with each other.

3c64df5f-8a81-4056-a716-f0eb1864d0b9-0
00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.184
So it's useful to see how their
evolution is going and and

3c64df5f-8a81-4056-a716-f0eb1864d0b9-1
00:24:22.184 --> 00:24:22.780
projected.

0473cdcd-387c-462d-b9ef-5ae94ad8d18f-0
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.630
OK, right understood. So and
also compared against each other

0473cdcd-387c-462d-b9ef-5ae94ad8d18f-1
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:33.072
what the, what the forecast
looks like as well. So what I'm

0473cdcd-387c-462d-b9ef-5ae94ad8d18f-2
00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:36.996
showing you at the moment
Bernard is the is the is a

0473cdcd-387c-462d-b9ef-5ae94ad8d18f-3
00:24:36.996 --> 00:24:41.438
design it's not built in the
platform yet but there is also

0473cdcd-387c-462d-b9ef-5ae94ad8d18f-4
00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:45.954
one thing. So this is the an
indication um indication graph,

0473cdcd-387c-462d-b9ef-5ae94ad8d18f-5
00:24:45.954 --> 00:24:50.322
right. So OK and it's you can
see that these are different

0473cdcd-387c-462d-b9ef-5ae94ad8d18f-6
00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:53.950
different products here. Yeah,
yeah so the idea.

dc91e229-8998-4f76-9356-884495a3be55-0
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.373
For the future is also, you
know, you should be able to

dc91e229-8998-4f76-9356-884495a3be55-1
00:24:57.373 --> 00:25:01.278
click through and go deeper into
the analysis as well. So is that

dc91e229-8998-4f76-9356-884495a3be55-2
00:25:01.278 --> 00:25:04.710
something that you would find
useful? Yes, yes. I mean we

dc91e229-8998-4f76-9356-884495a3be55-3
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.840
don't use it that often, we use
it.

964b7c4b-9277-4ca5-8765-9b809b544ab5-0
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.798
When we're doing a specific
analysis, and I would say

964b7c4b-9277-4ca5-8765-9b809b544ab5-1
00:25:13.798 --> 00:25:17.260
literally, maybe I'll do that
twice a year.

54ed873a-c762-4d0e-83cf-abb42580904c-0
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:22.058
Myself, other people will do it
more often or less often

54ed873a-c762-4d0e-83cf-abb42580904c-1
00:25:22.058 --> 00:25:25.663
depending on what they need it,
but for instance, when we're

54ed873a-c762-4d0e-83cf-abb42580904c-2
00:25:25.663 --> 00:25:27.200
doing our strategic plans.

e15511a8-3a08-491e-85a3-c4c082b1edfc-0
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.350
That's one of the things that we
do.

7f570dd0-c904-4413-a85f-ffa00aa70a9d-0
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.070
Right.

b25a48a4-e0cc-4e22-bd11-494ee3a6f70d-0
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.163
Understood. I mean, you know, it
doesn't matter how many times

b25a48a4-e0cc-4e22-bd11-494ee3a6f70d-1
00:25:35.163 --> 00:25:38.166
they are, right? It's the the
easiest it is the better. So,

b25a48a4-e0cc-4e22-bd11-494ee3a6f70d-2
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:41.270
um, of course. No, that feedback
is really useful. Thank you.

a7d1a5fe-75e5-4d49-b227-30d14db98685-0
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.285
I think that's everything that I
wanted to show you today Ankit.

a7d1a5fe-75e5-4d49-b227-30d14db98685-1
00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:47.530
Have I missed anything?

80dee19f-c312-42c5-9852-b74dd96d8f10-0
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.780
Um, I don't think so. So.

66ef0908-32a6-4ee2-9572-a71088e91ef1-0
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.748
You've done the overview of the
platform. Let me just go through

66ef0908-32a6-4ee2-9572-a71088e91ef1-1
00:25:54.748 --> 00:25:55.750
the stuff that I heard.

8b2a6d78-6ed1-4aca-9e76-b2bc481b3ff3-0
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:57.840


904e9ebd-343e-4b41-b2e2-31e653f6bd55-0
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.130
Bernard, did you have any views
on the?

810bc430-5bc5-4899-9393-7ef4cc423270-0
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.494
If you just um go back to the
index drugs index page, Magda,

810bc430-5bc5-4899-9393-7ef4cc423270-1
00:26:06.494 --> 00:26:11.230
did you have any views on the
events or the top three section?

2c3c4286-a2c3-4fa7-b1fa-9add4a1ddc47-0
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.065
Ohh, sorry, yeah, just the page
before this. So yeah, but not

2c3c4286-a2c3-4fa7-b1fa-9add4a1ddc47-1
00:26:18.065 --> 00:26:21.460
just just in that middle bit
where you sort of see the events

2c3c4286-a2c3-4fa7-b1fa-9add4a1ddc47-2
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.692
and the top three section. Is
that something that would be

2c3c4286-a2c3-4fa7-b1fa-9add4a1ddc47-3
00:26:24.692 --> 00:26:28.306
useful for you or would you sort
of scroll past that or what your

2c3c4286-a2c3-4fa7-b1fa-9add4a1ddc47-4
00:26:28.306 --> 00:26:29.840
general thoughts on that so?

7265cccc-6b18-495a-b23b-d81a9a184498-0
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.473
So this, this one, this
particular one where you've got

7265cccc-6b18-495a-b23b-d81a9a184498-1
00:26:35.473 --> 00:26:38.820
all drugs is actually not. I
mean it's it's.

93fea083-de53-464a-81c0-70018bdf5c63-0
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.965
It's something you put in a
report, but I know it's not

93fea083-de53-464a-81c0-70018bdf5c63-1
00:26:42.965 --> 00:26:44.910
something that I'd actually use
ever.

b126bbb0-4533-4078-95bc-b8ac8f95a6e5-0
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.380
So for instance, you have your
evaluate pharma report right

b126bbb0-4533-4078-95bc-b8ac8f95a6e5-1
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:49.620
for.

352fc8ea-7235-44fc-afdc-8684e5935a56-0
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.150
And you and you, you take that
as a the PDF that you create.

96cf15e6-2324-45cd-ba64-6cc076ae750f-0
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.729
Right. And so I do, I'd use the,
the, the figure that you use

96cf15e6-2324-45cd-ba64-6cc076ae750f-1
00:26:59.729 --> 00:27:04.419
where it places, OK, this is
oncology, this is cardiovascular

96cf15e6-2324-45cd-ba64-6cc076ae750f-2
00:27:04.419 --> 00:27:08.050
and so on, but I don't think I'd
go into depth.

9403b042-cf96-467a-a142-8ec64a136cb2-0
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.400
Overall, so I wouldn't need.

2ae0b716-52a8-4c8d-a4f7-b8e5b14e22a0-0
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.129
I think this is great as a high
level, but as a high level

2ae0b716-52a8-4c8d-a4f7-b8e5b14e22a0-1
00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:16.650
there's no point in trying to.

1f22b86a-036e-4b41-b3c7-2181fcccda4b-0
00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.840
Cover everything.

972ba352-06a2-4faf-9d7e-662ed7c98afe-0
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.110
And let me take that back.

b7fcd394-6700-4199-be64-99b677306afe-0
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.047
At a high level, this is
something that I can share,

b7fcd394-6700-4199-be64-99b677306afe-1
00:27:26.047 --> 00:27:28.550
share to a shareholder at a
shareholder meeting.

e731507b-fdcc-40f9-8d8c-ce5a9ffdc6bd-0
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:30.550
This is of no.

e26b219e-8d8c-4117-8d1c-267433f9c7d6-0
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.250
Intrinsic use to me.

a09dc8bd-31bf-4d07-884b-487d94ccb577-0
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.840
When I'm looking in a
therapeutic area.

49753db4-ef72-4236-a010-bc5bbb7027b7-0
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.381
Cool except you know to say Ohh
oncology is 20% of

49753db4-ef72-4236-a010-bc5bbb7027b7-1
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:44.915
cardiovascular or something like
that, but it's it's it's very

49753db4-ef72-4236-a010-bc5bbb7027b7-2
00:27:44.915 --> 00:27:49.306
it's it's big picture, really
big picture but I wouldn't use

49753db4-ef72-4236-a010-bc5bbb7027b7-3
00:27:49.306 --> 00:27:53.985
it as any detail for an analysis
per se. OK that makes sense. So

49753db4-ef72-4236-a010-bc5bbb7027b7-4
00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:58.088
to make it have intrinsic value
to yourself not just the

49753db4-ef72-4236-a010-bc5bbb7027b7-5
00:27:58.088 --> 00:28:02.767
shareholders, would you would it
be helpful once you philtre the

49753db4-ef72-4236-a010-bc5bbb7027b7-6
00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:06.510
data in the table so once you've
filtered that all.

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-0
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.100
Your metrics will then update
according to your philtres.

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-1
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.802
Would that then make it more
valuable? That would be useful.

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-2
00:28:13.802 --> 00:28:17.383
And at a lower level it's
useful. Fine for me because then

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-3
00:28:17.383 --> 00:28:21.025
I can actually use that for
saying, well, how come you know

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-4
00:28:21.025 --> 00:28:24.605
when I'm looking at then the
history, OK, how come they've

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-5
00:28:24.605 --> 00:28:28.308
done XY&amp;Z in this area? So
high level, what is it doing?

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-6
00:28:28.308 --> 00:28:32.313
And then we can philtre down and
see and and do the analysis then

cfd57bf6-8809-42cc-bd8f-7c3df21a4873-7
00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:35.470
that makes sense. And what about
the event section?

a47a5c61-6ad6-4620-9c48-47e045d881c6-0
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.900
Or the top three.

8778e93f-c073-4e84-9cbb-7c3b63b92ffe-0
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.260
You know.

e5b20728-1d52-4cb7-ad40-fafd2c6f8ed6-0
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.870
I can't say what the utility
will be at the moment because.

c00038bd-ca10-4c67-adc3-f08fe9586e18-0
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.220
Mike.

db8ccf0c-d650-45b3-aa69-d06fb76c81f8-0
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:58.315
The one thing I would just just
top of mind, there are so many

db8ccf0c-d650-45b3-aa69-d06fb76c81f8-1
00:28:58.315 --> 00:29:04.313
events that happen in in the
field of anyone therapeutic area

db8ccf0c-d650-45b3-aa69-d06fb76c81f8-2
00:29:04.313 --> 00:29:09.925
because that it is almost
impossible to keep track of the

db8ccf0c-d650-45b3-aa69-d06fb76c81f8-3
00:29:09.925 --> 00:29:11.860
the really key ones.

8e115f09-00a6-4c76-8707-d513bd7462d0-0
00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.400
Umm.

51aed307-ed9a-4ee5-8b13-ae9e46ead5fb-0
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.883
So if you take just as an
example, asthma that we just

51aed307-ed9a-4ee5-8b13-ae9e46ead5fb-1
00:29:17.883 --> 00:29:21.250
had, there's been quite a lot of
data coming out.

429f6445-df84-44b4-932d-db8bcc4ec131-0
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.426
I don't know how you can capture
all of that, because some of it

429f6445-df84-44b4-932d-db8bcc4ec131-1
00:29:25.426 --> 00:29:26.180
is going to be.

ad44e0a0-c137-4a61-bbfd-1fdc59de7923-0
00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.230
Oh, this is an interesting
article, but it's not going to

ad44e0a0-c137-4a61-bbfd-1fdc59de7923-1
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.160
change anything.

1f58e204-c863-48a9-bf86-8e8791ffbded-0
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:36.175
So I don't know what people are
maybe looking at if they're

1f58e204-c863-48a9-bf86-8e8791ffbded-1
00:29:36.175 --> 00:29:38.050
looking at key events are.

e08463c4-d5f1-42d8-9661-b6361d5f44de-0
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.610
OK, something is being got
registration.

d0b67e71-8e96-44e6-9822-b65cdf8b0ae5-0
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.950
So how do you philtre these
events to make sure that they

d0b67e71-8e96-44e6-9822-b65cdf8b0ae5-1
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.020
are relevant to the user here?

d2f5ec5b-c7c3-4051-92fc-72e064803dc4-0
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.180
And I don't know how you can do
that because.

9cb98295-0943-4f46-8220-869c1c9f662c-0
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.026
If you're gonna report, for
instance, uh checkpoint

9cb98295-0943-4f46-8220-869c1c9f662c-1
00:29:58.026 --> 00:29:58.700
inhibitors.

9c404c91-c0a0-423d-bda0-f7529e39086e-0
00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.338
There are hundreds of trials and
every time you go in you're

9c404c91-c0a0-423d-bda0-f7529e39086e-1
00:30:03.338 --> 00:30:07.352
going to see, you know, 50 new
trial. I'm exaggerating. Well,

9c404c91-c0a0-423d-bda0-f7529e39086e-2
00:30:07.352 --> 00:30:11.559
maybe not. Depends how often you
go in. But let's say you see 50

9c404c91-c0a0-423d-bda0-f7529e39086e-3
00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:13.890
new trials. It just becomes a
blur.

a505cf7d-56e9-408d-852d-54fe5cb2bdef-0
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:20.140
And it's basically loses
relevance, so I don't know how

a505cf7d-56e9-408d-852d-54fe5cb2bdef-1
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.890
you can.

2386176b-7133-46f5-85a4-3e1be5dfc6be-0
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.960
Philtre these events um.

1c618d2f-6987-4ab3-a610-153d4ae09bb2-0
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.257
In a way that makes sense to the
users, but it's it's almost like

1c618d2f-6987-4ab3-a610-153d4ae09bb2-1
00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:35.990
over overkill within with data
rather than information.

3c16fedb-b49c-4c35-8d17-4ec2c583c41c-0
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.440
That makes sense, but that's the
way to track it.

d7f9da9c-65ed-4c50-b0c1-fb85e0fca3ed-0
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.376
But it's, I don't know how
important it is to from an

d7f9da9c-65ed-4c50-b0c1-fb85e0fca3ed-1
00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:49.987
overview from an individual
product or an individual product

d7f9da9c-65ed-4c50-b0c1-fb85e0fca3ed-2
00:30:49.987 --> 00:30:50.520
category.

70943442-3fb7-46c6-ad94-32681329e2c6-0
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.240
It's it's quite useful.

82edcded-aad9-418f-9a98-24ec60c3f743-0
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.620
Right. I want to see what's
happened with, in this case, CDK

82edcded-aad9-418f-9a98-24ec60c3f743-1
00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.850
46, which is Ibrance.

7e7335f4-9028-4db1-b30c-d52ad2aa127d-0
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.520
What's happened in the last X
number of months?

e21d6473-ed72-4a76-b9cd-76b7e76ef528-0
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.980
That's, that's helpful.

8124fe9b-1b55-47a3-b6d1-d69010d0e442-0
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.810
But to have it across.

2e730fec-870c-4f2e-a4b2-e1913015f2fe-0
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:15.739
Full of breast cancer when there
are a minimum of 15 major modes

2e730fec-870c-4f2e-a4b2-e1913015f2fe-1
00:31:15.739 --> 00:31:16.670
of action.

eddbb2b0-8428-44f5-99b8-38918601c4d3-0
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.644
It's going to be overkill. I
mean it's just data dump as far

eddbb2b0-8428-44f5-99b8-38918601c4d3-1
00:31:21.644 --> 00:31:24.280
as I can see, unless we can if
it's a way of.

7334f2f3-b34e-49c7-ae87-0522d3d97092-0
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.000
Making it relevant and and
honestly I haven't thought about

7334f2f3-b34e-49c7-ae87-0522d3d97092-1
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.060
how to make it relevant or
especially when you're looking

7334f2f3-b34e-49c7-ae87-0522d3d97092-2
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.270
at.

25bab005-eb39-4bda-905a-563d509cd772-0
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.168
Results, let's say of a phase
two trial which needs then

25bab005-eb39-4bda-905a-563d509cd772-1
00:31:38.168 --> 00:31:40.290
interpretation. OK, what does
this mean?

4f3825c2-0e84-4897-8bc6-d17fd54b5cae-0
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.010
I think that's going into.

3ff3a801-582e-45f8-8d2b-79989f428f07-0
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:44.230
Yeah.

ec378795-99d1-44cd-b582-1c8752a1a3e1-0
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.000
Level of analysis that.

d22e647f-20e0-433c-9139-86ffb1b845e6-0
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.140
Would be difficult.

a1435e97-6629-40bf-8567-d84570100bc5-0
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.160
Or your folks to actually sort
of.

bee10990-f3f6-430a-ad06-cf7579450573-0
00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.330
Do we do this? We have a CI
department that looks at.

e5089389-1231-44ee-a922-b19899d4dfb6-0
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.358
You know drugs coming through
for each individual therapeutic

e5089389-1231-44ee-a922-b19899d4dfb6-1
00:32:05.358 --> 00:32:08.963
area and within that therapeutic
area let's say and again I'll

e5089389-1231-44ee-a922-b19899d4dfb6-2
00:32:08.963 --> 00:32:12.225
talk my own experience in in
breast cancer. So I'll look

e5089389-1231-44ee-a922-b19899d4dfb6-3
00:32:12.225 --> 00:32:15.831
specifically at breast cancer
and then at the meetings we will

e5089389-1231-44ee-a922-b19899d4dfb6-4
00:32:15.831 --> 00:32:19.264
have, I will do a report which
will be like 50 slides, it's

e5089389-1231-44ee-a922-b19899d4dfb6-5
00:32:19.264 --> 00:32:22.984
crazy, but fifty slides of this
is what's in Roman and these are

e5089389-1231-44ee-a922-b19899d4dfb6-6
00:32:22.984 --> 00:32:24.529
this is what the impact is.

761c641a-096b-4100-8620-f33dd413a4b6-0
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.957
Now that's only interesting for
people in that particular area

761c641a-096b-4100-8620-f33dd413a4b6-1
00:32:29.957 --> 00:32:33.795
who have relevance, but if you
take this up to senior

761c641a-096b-4100-8620-f33dd413a4b6-2
00:32:33.795 --> 00:32:35.430
management, they'll go.

3a0736cb-a155-4459-8f59-ae9855df65ee-0
00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.570
OK, so what's important here?

aa435014-b8e4-4be2-8a6b-4460c60a52f9-0
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.590
Of course, and that's and what I
would hope to get from this if

aa435014-b8e4-4be2-8a6b-4460c60a52f9-1
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:48.988
if it's possible, and I'm not
saying it is, I just think it's

aa435014-b8e4-4be2-8a6b-4460c60a52f9-2
00:32:48.988 --> 00:32:52.890
really difficult is to say this
is what the impact is.

c907f5c8-185c-4d84-83ac-8daed9dc8d13-0
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.840
As opposed to just an event.

6120ea89-86ed-4c91-a372-5566ea8f7e38-0
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.978
That's yeah. No, that's a really
interesting feedback actually.

6120ea89-86ed-4c91-a372-5566ea8f7e38-1
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:02.426
So, uh, yeah. That's why I
wanted to ask specifically on

6120ea89-86ed-4c91-a372-5566ea8f7e38-2
00:33:02.426 --> 00:33:05.131
that, just to say, you know, if
if it is useful and if not and

6120ea89-86ed-4c91-a372-5566ea8f7e38-3
00:33:05.131 --> 00:33:07.365
if not, then how would it be
more useful. So really

6120ea89-86ed-4c91-a372-5566ea8f7e38-4
00:33:07.365 --> 00:33:10.156
interesting feedback. We'll pass
that back to the team actually,

6120ea89-86ed-4c91-a372-5566ea8f7e38-5
00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:10.500
because.

567ec50c-8fb7-41c0-98ba-79e33e7fcd6b-0
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.550
If essentially it's taking up
space on the screen where it's

567ec50c-8fb7-41c0-98ba-79e33e7fcd6b-1
00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.838
not useful, or you want the
ability to choose what kind of

567ec50c-8fb7-41c0-98ba-79e33e7fcd6b-2
00:33:17.838 --> 00:33:21.238
events you see information for,
then you know it'll probably

567ec50c-8fb7-41c0-98ba-79e33e7fcd6b-3
00:33:21.238 --> 00:33:24.917
have more value to our users. So
really interesting feedback. The

567ec50c-8fb7-41c0-98ba-79e33e7fcd6b-4
00:33:24.917 --> 00:33:27.760
only other thing I wanted to
mention actually was.

a50dd5e4-4c51-405b-9a4c-111ea199379d-0
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.944
Just, uh, just to see whether
you use any of this kind of data

a50dd5e4-4c51-405b-9a4c-111ea199379d-1
00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:37.348
or any other sort of data, data
providers. Do you ever have a

a50dd5e4-4c51-405b-9a4c-111ea199379d-2
00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:41.680
need to see it while you're on
the go, IE remote on a mobile

a50dd5e4-4c51-405b-9a4c-111ea199379d-3
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.030
phone, on a tablet?

707fecde-3c6a-463a-a6b8-69d54358987e-0
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.560
No.

c9c2f68f-2f5e-48c8-b2f0-797079ca3419-0
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.770
Well, simple as that well.

fcd333f1-1c03-4a2f-a5a6-1c9fc4d0cfea-0
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.630
So I personally find that and
this is me and maybe I'm just

fcd333f1-1c03-4a2f-a5a6-1c9fc4d0cfea-1
00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.100
old fashioned. OK, so old school
I would say.

9dc119ab-57e9-4e67-9470-6f8e37071d1b-0
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.000
I find that uh.

682ed183-d14f-449a-9dce-5752dd093e32-0
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:11.069
The what? What do you want on a
mobile that's going to give you

682ed183-d14f-449a-9dce-5752dd093e32-1
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:14.228
specific data that I'm going to
present to my management. Well,

682ed183-d14f-449a-9dce-5752dd093e32-2
00:34:14.228 --> 00:34:14.920
the answer is.

ea079020-586a-40f4-b079-4a8ee1bc1fb6-0
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.780
If if you can get that data on a
mobile I'm I'm not needed.

99971323-f94e-4abb-a70e-811797775ca2-0
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.580
Right, because they'll have the
same access, so I needn't give

99971323-f94e-4abb-a70e-811797775ca2-1
00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.270
it to them.

781c9212-a650-47a3-aba6-b25264e7ecbe-0
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.540
Um and but.

ec37e39e-8ae7-415b-a1a8-5e05eaa0b070-0
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.585
What they're looking for is more
insights than the top line

ec37e39e-8ae7-415b-a1a8-5e05eaa0b070-1
00:34:36.585 --> 00:34:41.405
numbers, OK? And I'm not sure
that you know, working on a

ec37e39e-8ae7-415b-a1a8-5e05eaa0b070-2
00:34:41.405 --> 00:34:46.308
mobile for me is again, as I
said, I'm I'm old school. I I

ec37e39e-8ae7-415b-a1a8-5e05eaa0b070-3
00:34:46.308 --> 00:34:51.377
find it easier to use my my
laptop to give presentations and

ec37e39e-8ae7-415b-a1a8-5e05eaa0b070-4
00:34:51.377 --> 00:34:56.529
to sort them because at the end
what I do is I don't actually

ec37e39e-8ae7-415b-a1a8-5e05eaa0b070-5
00:34:56.529 --> 00:34:57.610
present them.

d30eff43-6133-4dd4-a48b-56f41ca77ee7-0
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.301
Raw data from your reports. I
present a synthesis of it in

d30eff43-6133-4dd4-a48b-56f41ca77ee7-1
00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:05.730
terms of. Here's A1 pager of.

016796f7-7c67-43c3-a0a4-7ecbd9612297-0
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.740
What was what? What are the key
events?

6c0c2543-ff52-44ff-9113-dade6c022ab8-0
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.980
What's happened, what are the
outcomes and what are we going

6c0c2543-ff52-44ff-9113-dade6c022ab8-1
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.620
to do about it?

e6f858c3-643e-4578-b006-894afb9c945a-0
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.470
Makes absolute sense, um.

2b553ffd-7cc0-400b-ac16-06d7de70dea5-0
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.114
Yeah. No, that makes sense. Um,
OK, cool. I don't think I have

2b553ffd-7cc0-400b-ac16-06d7de70dea5-1
00:35:24.114 --> 00:35:27.230
any more questions. Um, your
feedback has been extremely

2b553ffd-7cc0-400b-ac16-06d7de70dea5-2
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.675
helpful. So thank you. Thank you
for that. Is there any is, is

2b553ffd-7cc0-400b-ac16-06d7de70dea5-3
00:35:30.675 --> 00:35:33.955
there anything else you want to
add Bernard, just generally

2b553ffd-7cc0-400b-ac16-06d7de70dea5-4
00:35:33.955 --> 00:35:37.400
about the platform or any other
feedback that we've you've not

2b553ffd-7cc0-400b-ac16-06d7de70dea5-5
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.149
mentioned or we've not captured?

f5764142-6b37-4959-835f-04a0f2602046-0
00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.280
Listen, I'm very happy with what
I've got.

e5fccdbe-0823-45f6-98ff-02cb63a12424-0
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.958
And I know that Ted has got more
access. I have to say I I've

e5fccdbe-0823-45f6-98ff-02cb63a12424-1
00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:52.753
only needed to ask him for a
couple of times. So that

e5fccdbe-0823-45f6-98ff-02cb63a12424-2
00:35:52.753 --> 00:35:57.182
additional access because you
know the workhorse products that

e5fccdbe-0823-45f6-98ff-02cb63a12424-3
00:35:57.182 --> 00:35:59.080
I use are are in the basic.

2b4cad60-fb4e-481d-8b7e-b8833d93c099-0
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:05.987
And once in a while, some of
those additional information

2b4cad60-fb4e-481d-8b7e-b8833d93c099-1
00:36:05.987 --> 00:36:08.270
sources are are helpful.

1ae00e5b-e230-4c47-8343-98eea0cfa16d-0
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:09.900
Umm.

279d2cfb-04ed-40b3-9dcf-d31962c034f4-0
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.860
But I don't use the, you know.

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-0
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.882
I don't need it on hand,
basically. Yeah, cool. That's,

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-1
00:36:16.882 --> 00:36:20.207
that's been really helpful. And
um, yeah, I know we've got a

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-2
00:36:20.207 --> 00:36:23.804
couple of minutes, minutes left,
so you could you could have that

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-3
00:36:23.804 --> 00:36:27.347
time back just in terms of just
in terms of an outro. What we'll

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-4
00:36:27.347 --> 00:36:30.400
do is, and I know you're
obviously used to this because

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-5
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.888
you participated last round of
testing. We'll speak to a number

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-6
00:36:33.888 --> 00:36:37.431
of customers. We'll then collate
all of that feedback. I'll then

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-7
00:36:37.431 --> 00:36:40.865
summarise it in terms of what
you said and what we're going to

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-8
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.972
do about that. Um, and I'll
relay that over the next few

981c49fa-99dd-446e-ba5e-f2d6b14b9b1d-9
00:36:43.972 --> 00:36:44.300
weeks.

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-0
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.251
Over e-mail to you as well, so
just watch out for that. What

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-1
00:36:48.251 --> 00:36:51.961
I'd also say is you, you have
access to the platform yourself,

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-2
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:55.435
so the same way Magda went into
it. So if you log into the

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-3
00:36:55.435 --> 00:36:59.085
existing platform you'll see a
little blue button. So I would

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-4
00:36:59.085 --> 00:37:02.912
encourage you to just go in and
click around and play around for

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-5
00:37:02.912 --> 00:37:06.681
yourself because there could be
things that you've noticed from

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-6
00:37:06.681 --> 00:37:10.155
clicking around yourself that
you haven't while we've been

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-7
00:37:10.155 --> 00:37:13.982
doing a screen share. So yeah, I
will follow up on e-mail anyway

0753f114-3762-4370-a8af-8cc47b7faf92-8
00:37:13.982 --> 00:37:14.630
so you see.

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-0
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.041
Yeah, just a little blue button
there. So you could that's how

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-1
00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:21.375
you can access it. OK. So yeah,
have a have a look. Once you go

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-2
00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:24.553
into there, there is a little
purple icon at the bottom left

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-3
00:37:24.553 --> 00:37:27.834
of the screen. So if you just
click that because we've already

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-4
00:37:27.834 --> 00:37:31.064
had a one to one. If you just
want to give short feedback and

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-5
00:37:31.064 --> 00:37:34.242
you don't want to complete a
full survey, you can just click

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-6
00:37:34.242 --> 00:37:37.367
give feedback and it'll just
give you an option just to put

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-7
00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:40.492
your e-mail address and then
paste any screenshots and then

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-8
00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:43.774
it's just an open text field. Or
if you did want to complete a

0c74f63b-ac5a-428d-8899-c77302cc06a5-9
00:37:43.774 --> 00:37:45.649
survey, there is, there is sort
of.

db45b327-207f-49d4-ac7b-4a7643aee86e-0
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.015
50 to 20 questions that are
specifically about the features.

db45b327-207f-49d4-ac7b-4a7643aee86e-1
00:37:49.015 --> 00:37:52.094
So it's completely up to
yourself. OK sounds good. Cool.

db45b327-207f-49d4-ac7b-4a7643aee86e-2
00:37:52.094 --> 00:37:55.119

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:58.468
been a bit of an information
overload, so apologies for that.

db45b327-207f-49d4-ac7b-4a7643aee86e-4
00:37:58.468 --> 00:38:01.817
Cool. Well there. If there's
nothing else I'll close down the

db45b327-207f-49d4-ac7b-4a7643aee86e-5
00:38:01.817 --> 00:38:05.166

testing. Onwards and forwards

00:38:08.299 --> 00:38:11.594
made life continually improve.
Exactly and I hope you have a
