00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.152
Sure. That's your transition to
the new platform when the time

7fb9629a-5ce5-4f06-b23c-9a766a37533a-1
00:00:06.152 --> 00:00:09.798
is right is going to be as
smooth as possible. Really nice

7fb9629a-5ce5-4f06-b23c-9a766a37533a-2
00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:13.629
to meet you today and I'm just
going to echo what Ankit said,

7fb9629a-5ce5-4f06-b23c-9a766a37533a-3
00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.151
really grateful for for your

7fb9629a-5ce5-4f06-b23c-9a766a37533a-4
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:18.820
upcoming one today as well.

98b41055-5316-4e4b-a340-21cfdd6a2065-0
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.420
No problem. Yeah. So I'm. I'm an
information scientist advisor.

1cc56bab-bb14-477f-b319-24f81ce98779-0
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.765
Um, I sit in the, uh, what's
called the WDM group, so we're

1cc56bab-bb14-477f-b319-24f81ce98779-1
00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:38.675
worldwide research, development
and medical. Um, the part that I

1cc56bab-bb14-477f-b319-24f81ce98779-2
00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:43.040
mainly support is research and
development. So.

8d3f1b2a-df95-4b86-a3f6-241021997320-0
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.321
A lot of my use of um of the
platform is to do with our very

8d3f1b2a-df95-4b86-a3f6-241021997320-1
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:55.818
looking at information regarding
our very early portfolio

8d3f1b2a-df95-4b86-a3f6-241021997320-2
00:00:55.818 --> 00:01:01.979
decisions. And I mean when I say
early I mean kind of phase two,

8d3f1b2a-df95-4b86-a3f6-241021997320-3
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.950
phase one decisions that that go
no goes on those projects and

8d3f1b2a-df95-4b86-a3f6-241021997320-4
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.732
looking at the information in
terms of competitors the kinds

8d3f1b2a-df95-4b86-a3f6-241021997320-5
00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:14.869
of areas of.

0849617c-698d-436d-b16d-04b5a105ddd8-0
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.300
The target areas, the indication
areas, um, looking at um.

0f0afae9-9f84-48ab-88b2-f42fb10ba882-0
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.550
What's ahead as well? What's?
What's uh, what's kind of?

ebf7cc80-814e-4497-a52d-b22f007e008d-0
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.305
Being developed ahead of us. So
and I'm sure as a lot of other

ebf7cc80-814e-4497-a52d-b22f007e008d-1
00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:37.744
pharmaceutical companies our
goal is to be um first in class

ebf7cc80-814e-4497-a52d-b22f007e008d-2
00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:41.892
or if not first in class at
least best in class. So it's

ebf7cc80-814e-4497-a52d-b22f007e008d-3
00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:45.749
looking at, it's looking at that
information really.

b554039d-dfeb-412d-afe4-907c9c014d22-0
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.900
So yeah.

5f90b60b-51f9-44dc-a8df-5a1bb0a44cb9-0
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.494
Right. That's really useful.
Thank you for that, bilinda. No

5f90b60b-51f9-44dc-a8df-5a1bb0a44cb9-1
00:01:52.494 --> 00:01:52.970
problem.

afb7a0f6-8457-4170-a38c-2de231573c5b-0
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.910
Great. Um, I think we are good
to go with the demo then.

68df99e2-8251-4165-8313-863613dd6c6b-0
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.380
Let me just share my screen and
I'll switch my camera off to um

68df99e2-8251-4165-8313-863613dd6c6b-1
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.720
to minimize the distraction for.

b1ffd309-bf63-4f47-b3c9-bad019c69220-0
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.170
Um, from when I'm presenting. So
just a refresher, Belinda. This

b1ffd309-bf63-4f47-b3c9-bad019c69220-1
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.330
is where um.

cd6b30a9-5fec-4298-9bd6-24612aa12990-0
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.365
You can see my screen right? Yes
I see it, yes right. So this is

cd6b30a9-5fec-4298-9bd6-24612aa12990-1
00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:27.310
where you can access our new
platform the through the beta

cd6b30a9-5fec-4298-9bd6-24612aa12990-2
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.519
button that you have available
on the once you.

721dca48-4d4b-419f-aeaf-11cb8de15ef2-0
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.996
Once you look in um as the
pop-up window shows, you can

721dca48-4d4b-419f-aeaf-11cb8de15ef2-1
00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:38.380
access it through that link.

783eafb4-caae-4995-b1a3-a38ca11a4437-0
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.110
So.

9e087bf2-1706-4bb0-a569-c09c7f01b72e-0
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.476
Since you have lost tested with
us, we have added a list of

00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:54.130
when you were testing for us,
Belinda, this was just a

9e087bf2-1706-4bb0-a569-c09c7f01b72e-3
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.673
placeholder. Right now you can
access and this. As you can see

9e087bf2-1706-4bb0-a569-c09c7f01b72e-4
00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:02.711
I've got a few examples here.
Um, you're recently saved

9e087bf2-1706-4bb0-a569-c09c7f01b72e-5
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:07.255

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.890
Um, and then the create new
report button. We made it bigger

6043766c-c253-4d93-8f0d-6ff054039704-1
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.829
to make sure that it's easily
visible and accessible to

6043766c-c253-4d93-8f0d-6ff054039704-2
00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.260
everyone. Um to just be able to

6043766c-c253-4d93-8f0d-6ff054039704-3
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.832
analysis from from scratch. Some
of these are still placeholders

6043766c-c253-4d93-8f0d-6ff054039704-4
00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:39.559
as you are aware, but we are
still working on those.

756e18a5-fab3-48ee-851d-b8d83ee73834-0
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.118
Um to umm to make sure that we
include them in the in the next

756e18a5-fab3-48ee-851d-b8d83ee73834-1
00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:49.528
releases. So a short summary of
what has been added to the

756e18a5-fab3-48ee-851d-b8d83ee73834-2
00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:50.500
landing page.

832d0b18-6b37-4b51-aeee-6849e00f4c43-0
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.030
Any faults? Any feedback on
this?

9457344d-4034-4c99-beaa-0f5a41a56953-0
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.050
No, that's good. That's good. I
mean, uh.

0aab4b13-02ff-4d7b-8f08-0f5f22b01adb-0
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.350
It's good to have that great
port report up.

8cf9b66e-9ec8-49ee-a3eb-d76f83d40196-0
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.320
Up front and centre and and the
recently saved ones as well.

0a9727cd-98a8-42b7-8068-ce57e17ea42f-0
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.020
For sure.

2f7082e0-3e57-4d74-8322-a8578a41470b-0
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.650
Yeah.

9481b7d2-f0bf-4a0b-b2d7-cc5f4406109b-0
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.710
Right. OK.

3b09cc04-78c0-4f89-a058-dc70f67d6b73-0
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.320
Good. Great to hear that. Thank
you.

a870e89f-98f3-4d8d-b87f-b14962d9ec3e-0
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.999
OK, so let's create a new
report. Um. So as we press, uh,

a870e89f-98f3-4d8d-b87f-b14962d9ec3e-1
00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.370
that button, then we get the UM.

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-0
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.228
The window here and um this list
mind you is is slightly

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-1
00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:40.382
shortened than it will be when
we are finished with the

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-2
00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:45.130
product. But you can see there
are different um starting points

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-3
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.507
for your report that you can
choose from. So let's go with

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-4
00:04:49.507 --> 00:04:53.958
indications. You did mention
that sometimes this is how you

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-5
00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:58.113
run your analysis. So if we
click create reports then a

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-6
00:04:58.113 --> 00:05:01.896
report with default and
previously added pre added

1bc181c3-0c61-4b8b-9718-54083b779266-7
00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:02.489
columns.

321acd36-8486-4bab-91c9-1683b5cf870a-0
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.660
Um, pops up on your page. You
can then able to.

ad57a875-0b30-451a-a67e-5517e4b76af8-0
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.770
You are then able to manipulate
it further so as we go through

ad57a875-0b30-451a-a67e-5517e4b76af8-1
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.630
the, uh, manage columns here.

e7032078-5a74-406b-ac0f-945d8841a908-0
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.761
You can see these are the
columns that we have preselected

e7032078-5a74-406b-ac0f-945d8841a908-1
00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:24.134
for you. Um, it's 20 in total.
And then on the left hand side

e7032078-5a74-406b-ac0f-945d8841a908-2
00:05:24.134 --> 00:05:28.508
we have grouped our data points
into different categories for

e7032078-5a74-406b-ac0f-945d8841a908-3
00:05:28.508 --> 00:05:32.599
you to be able to um add
anything else that you find that

e7032078-5a74-406b-ac0f-945d8841a908-4
00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.010
you may find useful.

d9147979-663f-43c3-ae9d-86f82d6b5485-0
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.990
You have a search bar here, so
whatever you type in here.

2a7d3abe-42a2-43f1-820d-78dd97f1c728-0
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.270
Let's go with date um, all of
the.

8909d4c5-b41f-42af-9cdc-59222fee635a-0
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.240
All of the data points that
contain that phrase.

ed09aa58-1b91-44bc-bf7d-59001e238a8c-0
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.025
Across all of those folders are
going to pop up. Here you can

ed09aa58-1b91-44bc-bf7d-59001e238a8c-1
00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:57.950
see we have already couple of
date fields selected as well.

573a5dd1-ba02-4fd1-a820-54796c343a54-0
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.715
And then you can also expand
each of those folders and just

573a5dd1-ba02-4fd1-a820-54796c343a54-1
00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:08.100
search within that folder to
find whatever you need and you

573a5dd1-ba02-4fd1-a820-54796c343a54-2
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.340
can see that the each of those
folders have also been um.

0c625354-9281-41c5-a525-7718157e15ec-0
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.621
Segmented um with the UM with
relevant data points under

0c625354-9281-41c5-a525-7718157e15ec-1
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:23.728
different categories as well to
to make them easier to find

0c625354-9281-41c5-a525-7718157e15ec-2
00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:24.580
hopefully.

63b22b76-4003-4102-9005-ab7d24133107-0
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.660
So I do appreciate it was a lot
of information. Um.

18cd0f0b-f974-40e9-a7fc-61c916f4b852-0
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.889
I'm going to stop here for a
second for any questions Belinda

18cd0f0b-f974-40e9-a7fc-61c916f4b852-1
00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.780
you might have may have or any
pointers for us maybe.

51105d82-60aa-4c2b-8c1b-453731ab702c-0
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.315
No, it looks good. It looks a
lot simpler than the previous

51105d82-60aa-4c2b-8c1b-453731ab702c-1
00:06:42.315 --> 00:06:42.930
two step.

87f7d988-82a8-4bec-9875-a314d49ebdbf-0
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.612
Process. And I'm assuming, um,
with the active columns that you

87f7d988-82a8-4bec-9875-a314d49ebdbf-1
00:06:49.612 --> 00:06:54.677
just can, uh, drag and drop to
change order. Is that right?

87f7d988-82a8-4bec-9875-a314d49ebdbf-2
00:06:54.677 --> 00:06:59.320
Yes, that's exactly right. Yes.
OK yeah, good to know.

827f21e1-9efa-4133-b4a3-fa9f22905cd2-0
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.960
So let me just show you.

43178542-9532-424f-a74e-6a218fab537a-0
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.972
Because last time I think when
you tested that option wasn't

43178542-9532-424f-a74e-6a218fab537a-1
00:07:06.972 --> 00:07:11.291
really that visible. So at right
now you can drag and you can see

43178542-9532-424f-a74e-6a218fab537a-2
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:15.611
where that column is going to um
to land when you drop it. So um,

43178542-9532-424f-a74e-6a218fab537a-3
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:18.360
we've added that a little bit of
shading.

adc7fba9-268d-454c-8fc4-aa297f132e86-0
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.079
Um, on here as well. Yeah,
that's very clear. That's good.

adc7fba9-268d-454c-8fc4-aa297f132e86-1
00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:29.024
That's good. And uh, what do you
how do you choose what you sort

adc7fba9-268d-454c-8fc4-aa297f132e86-2
00:07:29.024 --> 00:07:30.090
the column by?

199f5fda-ffd4-422b-8b62-67835a08e8b9-0
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.910
When I saw the actual report.
Sorry, yeah.

6aa9683d-f7a5-4b7a-8aef-d6e60570d675-0
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.173
What I sort the column. Ohh OK,
so that's the that's on the

6aa9683d-f7a5-4b7a-8aef-d6e60570d675-1
00:07:42.173 --> 00:07:45.150
report itself. So let me just
show you um.

f51eec24-8ccb-41d5-abc8-495d1480a635-0
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.003
But before we do that, let me
just show this little button.

f51eec24-8ccb-41d5-abc8-495d1480a635-1
00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:52.144
Uh, this little red button here
also allows you to quickly

f51eec24-8ccb-41d5-abc8-495d1480a635-2
00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:54.539
remove columns that you may not
find useful.

13c6e394-2c4c-474b-9d9d-b54469c1d3aa-0
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.350
So cool, let's apply changes.

47ba080f-0d46-4136-b013-50736b9061fb-0
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.996
And here is the report and then
as you hover over those columns

47ba080f-0d46-4136-b013-50736b9061fb-1
00:08:04.996 --> 00:08:10.024
you can see the three dot menu.
So this is where you do your

47ba080f-0d46-4136-b013-50736b9061fb-2
00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:12.910
sorting and your filtering. OK
so.

bf3f4dc7-dd02-42ce-bbeb-eb0f982ca848-0
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.060
This is an example, but it's a.
It's a text column field, so um.

2ff7dbc8-0a9c-4c86-9624-834840573ce4-0
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.092
You can either select from a
dropdown list or search, or do

2ff7dbc8-0a9c-4c86-9624-834840573ce4-1
00:08:23.092 --> 00:08:27.413
both so you can mix and match
your filtering however you find

2ff7dbc8-0a9c-4c86-9624-834840573ce4-2
00:08:27.413 --> 00:08:30.690
um, however you find useful, so
we can select.

8af71555-cb3f-40e8-96df-70f75919084f-0
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.664
A few things here. And then if
we want to include all of the

8af71555-cb3f-40e8-96df-70f75919084f-1
00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:39.240
sodium compounds as well, then
we can also do that.

7e63dd3b-4255-45c0-8970-88676582a615-0
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.030
So let's apply filters.

89f8a420-1db6-4410-a3ba-e01ea62cbfc4-0
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.890
And then this is the, these are
our results for now. Just a

89f8a420-1db6-4410-a3ba-e01ea62cbfc4-1
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.829
little disclaimer, obviously not
all of that data that we have

89f8a420-1db6-4410-a3ba-e01ea62cbfc4-2
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:56.579
available on evaluate platform
has been migrated to the new

89f8a420-1db6-4410-a3ba-e01ea62cbfc4-3
00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:00.518
platform yet. Some of these are
just placeholders just to give

89f8a420-1db6-4410-a3ba-e01ea62cbfc4-4
00:09:00.518 --> 00:09:04.269
you an idea what it will look
like. So if something doesn't

89f8a420-1db6-4410-a3ba-e01ea62cbfc4-5
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:08.270
look right in terms of the data,
this is the that's the reason.

cd997b05-88f3-43fb-b99b-ef92f3e03f3c-0
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.006
So no, it makes sense. It makes
sense. That's good. So yeah,

cd997b05-88f3-43fb-b99b-ef92f3e03f3c-1
00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:16.720
it's a lot easier to sort
through the. In the old report,

cd997b05-88f3-43fb-b99b-ef92f3e03f3c-2
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.410
sorting was very complicated,
I've found.

0df72a27-d353-4730-b8e6-93ed3d4f67cd-0
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.965
But uh, yeah, this is very, this
is very useful because uh, quite

0df72a27-d353-4730-b8e6-93ed3d4f67cd-1
00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:28.254
often with the, when we're
looking at information, it's

0df72a27-d353-4730-b8e6-93ed3d4f67cd-2
00:09:28.254 --> 00:09:31.660
it's great to be able to uh,
slice and dice it by certain

0df72a27-d353-4730-b8e6-93ed3d4f67cd-3
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.242
categories. So for instance
small versus large molecules and

0df72a27-d353-4730-b8e6-93ed3d4f67cd-4
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.590
in a particular indication. So
yeah, that's really good.

bf60ce53-adda-40e7-9bbf-30d0af99108a-0
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.149
Right, that's really useful
feedback. Thank you. Um, just

bf60ce53-adda-40e7-9bbf-30d0af99108a-1
00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:48.232
another function that I wanted
to show you. We also added the

bf60ce53-adda-40e7-9bbf-30d0af99108a-2
00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:52.051
umm pin column to the left
option. So now you can see the

bf60ce53-adda-40e7-9bbf-30d0af99108a-3
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:56.200
generic name column is on your
left hand side and as we scroll

bf60ce53-adda-40e7-9bbf-30d0af99108a-4
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.414
our report to the right to get
to the columns further down, you

bf60ce53-adda-40e7-9bbf-30d0af99108a-5
00:10:00.414 --> 00:10:03.510
can see what data they actually
correspond to.

af469249-d008-4577-8a55-9541de3bee31-0
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.810
Yeah, which is a new feature.

e745ba7b-ea1c-4d71-ab14-7a1593a2f51e-0
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.270
And then in terms of filtering.

3e461fec-4432-4f45-8199-7d8373914e05-0
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.873
There is a slightly different
option for filtering your

3e461fec-4432-4f45-8199-7d8373914e05-1
00:10:17.873 --> 00:10:22.382
numerical fields so that applies
to all of the accounts or um

3e461fec-4432-4f45-8199-7d8373914e05-2
00:10:22.382 --> 00:10:26.673
sales fields as well. So if we
click through show filters,

3e461fec-4432-4f45-8199-7d8373914e05-3
00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:30.892
these are the options that you
have. So a little bit of a

3e461fec-4432-4f45-8199-7d8373914e05-4
00:10:30.892 --> 00:10:32.420
functionality that's.

b36e6705-2871-4cd8-9fa1-bedb5cdd3bcd-0
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.820
Similar to Excel without having
to export your report.

97d7d214-941a-44a1-b4f5-e0719aca0c2c-0
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.810
So we can do less than let's go
20.

2aea65a0-1316-4377-8798-59c84d0cf5f5-0
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.060
They filter.

17bb78f2-7ef9-46f5-8e04-320725d7a4ee-0
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.840
And you only get your.

672b360e-7857-4061-bf59-8b10fe7772c1-0
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.280
Relevant information here.

c94911d0-e168-4570-a786-1e5830b0da52-0
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.589
So that's the numerical filter
and then slightly different

c94911d0-e168-4570-a786-1e5830b0da52-1
00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:03.678
filter options for your date
fields. Also sort sorting is

c94911d0-e168-4570-a786-1e5830b0da52-2
00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:08.049
available on all tile types of
fields as well, so you can see

c94911d0-e168-4570-a786-1e5830b0da52-3
00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:12.561
for dates you can select from a
specific date or to or within a

c94911d0-e168-4570-a786-1e5830b0da52-4
00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:13.830
range as well. OK.

fe3fba53-aed2-4e08-9ae5-f956a1105427-0
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.734
Is that something you would find
useful? Yes, definitely,

fe3fba53-aed2-4e08-9ae5-f956a1105427-1
00:11:19.734 --> 00:11:23.458
definitely. I mean particularly
the date ones I think would be.

fe3fba53-aed2-4e08-9ae5-f956a1105427-2
00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:25.320
It would be very useful in that.

a87e0a9d-d6e4-4c46-88c7-dde2d3fb74e8-0
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:31.323
Um, in terms of what? Is it just
the generic name that you can

a87e0a9d-d6e4-4c46-88c7-dde2d3fb74e8-1
00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:36.080
pin to the left, or can you
choose what you pin on that left

a87e0a9d-d6e4-4c46-88c7-dde2d3fb74e8-2
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.860
hand side?

bb794219-937c-45d2-b519-eead6294534e-0
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.152
You can choose any other column.
All of those have that

bb794219-937c-45d2-b519-eead6294534e-1
00:11:41.152 --> 00:11:44.892
functionality. So yeah, whatever
is is um is relevant for you at

bb794219-937c-45d2-b519-eead6294534e-2
00:11:44.892 --> 00:11:45.410
the time.

46567fb2-178e-4efb-899a-e6c2a4965d55-0
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.080
OK, great. That's good to know.

c4e01c61-1811-4f02-85da-a5ab16de2b20-0
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.762
Right. OK. Ohh it. Just a quick
question in terms of the date

c4e01c61-1811-4f02-85da-a5ab16de2b20-1
00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:59.390
field, as you can see you can
filter on a specific as go as

c4e01c61-1811-4f02-85da-a5ab16de2b20-2
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.249
granular as a day level. Is that
something that you would find

c4e01c61-1811-4f02-85da-a5ab16de2b20-3
00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:09.108
useful or would you go maybe a
high slightly less granular and

c4e01c61-1811-4f02-85da-a5ab16de2b20-4
00:12:09.108 --> 00:12:13.659
let's say I don't know a month
and a year. Yeah, it's it's

c4e01c61-1811-4f02-85da-a5ab16de2b20-5
00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:17.593
always useful to see the
granular day. I think one

c4e01c61-1811-4f02-85da-a5ab16de2b20-6
00:12:17.593 --> 00:12:20.910
probably when I come to kind of
filtering.

fee34470-2c18-419f-bf81-f1696b8bcb4d-0
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.503
It maybe wouldn't be quite as
granular. It would be more

fee34470-2c18-419f-bf81-f1696b8bcb4d-1
00:12:24.503 --> 00:12:28.440
likely to be at the most a month
than a year, more likely just a

fee34470-2c18-419f-bf81-f1696b8bcb4d-2
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.135
year. But um, it's it's always
good to see the granular date

fee34470-2c18-419f-bf81-f1696b8bcb4d-3
00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:32.560
though.

9b742a00-f130-43a7-8789-a28caa33594a-0
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.950
OK, understood.

2d5ee515-b61d-49be-8812-1367d1f9adf0-0
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.934
Alright so this is the the
reports upgrade that we have

2d5ee515-b61d-49be-8812-1367d1f9adf0-1
00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:46.732
done recently. As you can see we
can save every single report

2d5ee515-b61d-49be-8812-1367d1f9adf0-2
00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:51.530
that we have been working with.
You can also download it with

2d5ee515-b61d-49be-8812-1367d1f9adf0-3
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.150
into uh.

6f59def0-86c2-479d-a14c-4dd82afa8eb3-0
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.588
CSV or Excel file as well, yeah
um and we can click here and you

6f59def0-86c2-479d-a14c-4dd82afa8eb3-1
00:12:58.588 --> 00:13:03.490
can see our newly created report
is on on our list here.

67e4726c-3164-4569-8042-209dcd66faa3-0
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.855
Um, so that's what we have added
and then let's go back to the to

67e4726c-3164-4569-8042-209dcd66faa3-1
00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:13.175
the landing page. So um search
we still working on, but we will

67e4726c-3164-4569-8042-209dcd66faa3-2
00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:17.090
definitely let you know when
that's available through the

67e4726c-3164-4569-8042-209dcd66faa3-3
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.667
menu button we can go to
different um different data

67e4726c-3164-4569-8042-209dcd66faa3-4
00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:24.785
points where you can start your
analysis from. So all of not

67e4726c-3164-4569-8042-209dcd66faa3-5
00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:28.700
all, some of them are still
placeholders but we can click

67e4726c-3164-4569-8042-209dcd66faa3-6
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.240
through.

25beddf6-50e7-4001-8825-0231d9a5367b-0
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.010
Drugs here.

58825085-c3ea-4b75-a487-b8f8a5cd32d1-0
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.964
And then here you can see the
top level KPIs that we have for

58825085-c3ea-4b75-a487-b8f8a5cd32d1-1
00:13:36.964 --> 00:13:40.699
the entirety of evaluate
universe that we cover when it

58825085-c3ea-4b75-a487-b8f8a5cd32d1-2
00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:41.699
comes to drugs.

d4d1b6ee-9bda-44dd-997f-7a7eab5be5c6-0
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.969
Latest events again, uh,
placeholders at the moment, and

d4d1b6ee-9bda-44dd-997f-7a7eab5be5c6-1
00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:51.858
then the top of the selected
classifications as well. And as

d4d1b6ee-9bda-44dd-997f-7a7eab5be5c6-2
00:13:51.858 --> 00:13:56.748
we Scroll down, we also have an
embedded report that you can

d4d1b6ee-9bda-44dd-997f-7a7eab5be5c6-3
00:13:56.748 --> 00:14:02.038
also edit in the same way as the
one that we have just created or

d4d1b6ee-9bda-44dd-997f-7a7eab5be5c6-4
00:14:02.038 --> 00:14:07.088
saved if you want to have it at
hand whenever you whenever you

d4d1b6ee-9bda-44dd-997f-7a7eab5be5c6-5
00:14:07.088 --> 00:14:07.649
log in.

1545999d-30d5-4363-a4f0-cddfa0daabb1-0
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:09.400
Yeah.

19bb5501-0250-4305-be29-e3f591aea488-0
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.290
Yeah, that's good. That's good
to have still have those

19bb5501-0250-4305-be29-e3f591aea488-1
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.439
embedded reports because I did
used to use those quite a lot.

19bb5501-0250-4305-be29-e3f591aea488-2
00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:25.754
When I wasn't really sure where
to start maybe or what category

19bb5501-0250-4305-be29-e3f591aea488-3
00:14:25.754 --> 00:14:30.902
to pick to get to the topics I
wanted. I looked down the menu

19bb5501-0250-4305-be29-e3f591aea488-4
00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:36.134
list and you quite often have
some reports prepopulated that I

19bb5501-0250-4305-be29-e3f591aea488-5
00:14:36.134 --> 00:14:40.369
could go and edit. So that's
always useful to see.

2d0841d2-4cb1-4655-bcf6-0fe4e34c8bac-0
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.072
From my point of view, but then
saying that they're creating the

2d0841d2-4cb1-4655-bcf6-0fe4e34c8bac-1
00:14:44.072 --> 00:14:47.593
reports you've made that much
easier that I'm. I'm sure I will

2d0841d2-4cb1-4655-bcf6-0fe4e34c8bac-2
00:14:47.593 --> 00:14:50.220
find it easier to find the
topics that I need.

3e3f2f1e-d744-4b41-b695-a658e6250105-0
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.630
Right. Really glad to hear that.

0aac5963-cc79-47ed-9ed8-3b27099836cb-0
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.042
Umm, so this is what we have.
Some of these are placeholders,

0aac5963-cc79-47ed-9ed8-3b27099836cb-1
00:14:59.042 --> 00:15:03.564
but we are also thinking about,
you know, having here a chart to

0aac5963-cc79-47ed-9ed8-3b27099836cb-2
00:15:03.564 --> 00:15:07.807
summarize whatever we are on
the, uh, currently on the page.

0aac5963-cc79-47ed-9ed8-3b27099836cb-3
00:15:07.807 --> 00:15:11.912
So in this instance, we would
have a summary of drug sales

0aac5963-cc79-47ed-9ed8-3b27099836cb-4
00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:16.224
within a specific date range,
like here for example. So a bar

0aac5963-cc79-47ed-9ed8-3b27099836cb-5
00:15:16.224 --> 00:15:20.468
chart, is that something that
you would find useful or is it

0aac5963-cc79-47ed-9ed8-3b27099836cb-6
00:15:20.468 --> 00:15:23.389
not necessarily needed for your
analysis?

4690336b-92fa-48f4-8d74-462653004ac8-0
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.130
Um.

293fe8b2-e7d1-4bfb-89be-9cee293d4525-0
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.863
It depends what you're going to
visually put on there. Sales,

293fe8b2-e7d1-4bfb-89be-9cee293d4525-1
00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:36.078
not so much for from my point of
view, but I'm sure there would

293fe8b2-e7d1-4bfb-89be-9cee293d4525-2
00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:40.030
be others that would find the
sales interesting. But if say

293fe8b2-e7d1-4bfb-89be-9cee293d4525-3
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.245
for instance, there's a number
of drugs in development in phase

293fe8b2-e7d1-4bfb-89be-9cee293d4525-4
00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:48.460
three phase in different phases
on on the various bits, but uh,

293fe8b2-e7d1-4bfb-89be-9cee293d4525-5
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:48.789
yeah.

b66ad5aa-0704-4b4f-8509-909e7e9b3557-0
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.180
That that could be interesting
to me.

4bd00d7d-5b11-4bf6-bae8-996cef1baf88-0
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.850
OK, that's useful to know. Um,
so.

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-0
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.643
It hasn't been built yet. So
those KPIs are placeholders at

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-1
00:16:03.643 --> 00:16:07.624
the moment. But the idea of the
new platform is for you to be

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-2
00:16:07.624 --> 00:16:11.028
able to click through and go
more granular with your

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-3
00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:14.432
analysis. Yeah, so as I said,
this is the high level

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-4
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:18.414
everything in terms of evaluate
coverage in terms of numbers.

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-5
00:16:18.414 --> 00:16:22.203
But in future if you were able
to, let's say click through

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-6
00:16:22.203 --> 00:16:26.056
here, phase two, you did say
that you focus mostly on phase

22bb6334-4dc3-4c10-8eeb-d8823a169ef6-7
00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:28.239
two, phase one and earlier
drugs.

96da9bbd-df33-4c4d-879b-20a16f0486ea-0
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.988
Would that be useful to then
take you to a similar looking

96da9bbd-df33-4c4d-879b-20a16f0486ea-1
00:16:31.988 --> 00:16:33.230
page but all of these?

a6ea5367-4521-4596-858c-7e19cde46b65-0
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.733
Would be only relevant to phase
two drugs? Yes, definitely,

a6ea5367-4521-4596-858c-7e19cde46b65-1
00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:39.510
definitely.

f6264aad-11f2-4edd-8fc2-10d1cc3b105d-0
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.900
Right, that's really useful to
know.

8d5569ac-9c74-4886-b7cd-4af8e5d6ce2b-0
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.498
OK. Let me just show you and let
me just filter quickly on a drug

8d5569ac-9c74-4886-b7cd-4af8e5d6ce2b-1
00:16:49.498 --> 00:16:51.320
that might give us some.

7ba98c71-d4f4-49e4-8436-e58fefe4b20f-0
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.890
Data here so.

8eafde40-16dc-4047-91e4-d3b4036710b2-0
00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:01.352
We have also added recently a A
click through option through the

8eafde40-16dc-4047-91e4-d3b4036710b2-1
00:17:01.352 --> 00:17:03.910
generic name to take us to the.

41007a6b-3e55-4b1e-9efb-0842522b86e6-0
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.194
Product Um item page so this
just to give you an idea I do

41007a6b-3e55-4b1e-9efb-0842522b86e6-1
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:12.798
appreciate it's not you know
related to face the drugs but

41007a6b-3e55-4b1e-9efb-0842522b86e6-2
00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:16.463
this is just to give you an idea
what it would look like it

41007a6b-3e55-4b1e-9efb-0842522b86e6-3
00:17:16.463 --> 00:17:20.372
obviously you know changed all
of that information only applies

41007a6b-3e55-4b1e-9efb-0842522b86e6-4
00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.900
to to the product now so.

e0c77834-eaec-4d71-9ab7-dd09a01a4877-0
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.608
You've got the sales, you've got
number you, you will have number

e0c77834-eaec-4d71-9ab7-dd09a01a4877-1
00:17:27.608 --> 00:17:32.190
of of different um. Well that's
the highest faced, OK. So you

e0c77834-eaec-4d71-9ab7-dd09a01a4877-2
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.930
will have.

de52c95a-0b77-414a-9b90-810fa3b90b40-0
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.365
Um. Number of different products
related to a generic name at

de52c95a-0b77-414a-9b90-810fa3b90b40-1
00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:44.151
different stages of development?
Um. And then all of the

de52c95a-0b77-414a-9b90-810fa3b90b40-2
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:48.770
companies involved in the in the
product and so on so.

cd54da31-a117-4804-ae03-9f1d8b037950-0
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.490
Is that something that you would
find useful? Potentially, yes,

cd54da31-a117-4804-ae03-9f1d8b037950-1
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.451
definitely. I'm assuming. I'm
assuming that the number of

cd54da31-a117-4804-ae03-9f1d8b037950-2
00:17:58.451 --> 00:18:01.729
drugs by ice phase, I'm assuming
that would be.

30896505-9bef-4161-89e2-6a6d21caa756-0
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.821
Particularly if it was looking
at uh, different uh indications.

30896505-9bef-4161-89e2-6a6d21caa756-1
00:18:06.821 --> 00:18:10.920
So I know sometimes you have you
can have like a monoclonal

30896505-9bef-4161-89e2-6a6d21caa756-2
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.745
that's been developed for um
arthritis type indications

30896505-9bef-4161-89e2-6a6d21caa756-3
00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:18.639
versus cancer indications
because I can see that the one

30896505-9bef-4161-89e2-6a6d21caa756-4
00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:22.874
for this one's quite a general
one, isn't it a general cancer

30896505-9bef-4161-89e2-6a6d21caa756-5
00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:27.246
indication. So is is that what
I'm am I assuming that correctly

30896505-9bef-4161-89e2-6a6d21caa756-6
00:18:27.246 --> 00:18:31.140
for that number of drugs by
highest phase part on there?

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-0
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.778
So that's yes, that's that's a
good point. So if it was an

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-1
00:18:35.778 --> 00:18:39.003
indication page, this is what
you would be able to see a

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-2
00:18:39.003 --> 00:18:42.115
number of drugs, different
stages of development for a

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-3
00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:45.623
particular indication therapy
area and so on and so on. Yeah,

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-4
00:18:45.623 --> 00:18:49.131
this is just to give you an idea
what it would look like. And

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-5
00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:52.696
then you know let's say we are
on the breast cancer page, then

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-6
00:18:52.696 --> 00:18:56.147
you click through phase two,
phase one and that takes you to

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-7
00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:59.825
phase one breast cancer and then
yeah and then this is even more

52b9cab7-d53c-4ec1-b415-ded02fb9fe09-8
00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:01.239
granular in terms of the.

7591a25c-ab3c-463d-bfb4-8c7c6943f4e9-0
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.943
Of where you want to, where you
want to go potentially. Yeah.

7591a25c-ab3c-463d-bfb4-8c7c6943f4e9-1
00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:07.850
Yeah. Got it. Sounds good. Yeah.

c5c2a114-21f6-46e6-ba39-57cb62992a03-0
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.058
Right. Um, I think that's
everything I wanted to cover

c5c2a114-21f6-46e6-ba39-57cb62992a03-1
00:19:13.058 --> 00:19:16.010
today. Ankit, is there anything
that um?

5cf8e8a7-4e18-4011-b9ab-d9f808e96522-0
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.670
That we still wanted to discuss
today.

0414ab4f-de68-4c24-ba08-c17a8e52f55b-0
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.501
Um, no, I think I think it was,
yeah, fairly short just because

0414ab4f-de68-4c24-ba08-c17a8e52f55b-1
00:19:24.501 --> 00:19:28.381
of, um, the previous tests that
Belinda's done. So, um, I'm just

0414ab4f-de68-4c24-ba08-c17a8e52f55b-2
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:31.964
trying to think if there's
anything else maybe with regards

0414ab4f-de68-4c24-ba08-c17a8e52f55b-3
00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:35.725
to those designs that we've got
for visualizations. So I know,

0414ab4f-de68-4c24-ba08-c17a8e52f55b-4
00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:39.666
Belinda, you mentioned that they
not all charts would be helpful,

0414ab4f-de68-4c24-ba08-c17a8e52f55b-5
00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:43.308
but for the ones that you are
looking at, maybe if you could

0414ab4f-de68-4c24-ba08-c17a8e52f55b-6
00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:46.950
give us some feedback on some of
the designs that we've got.

a8a507e0-e6d2-49f1-b87f-aacff408441e-0
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.040
That'd be helpful.

f100a4ee-0894-49c0-aaba-0ab49ad2f280-0
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.150
Ohh.

e19cf814-2aed-47a6-850f-626bf3637ac5-0
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.097
That is true. That's a good
point actually. Um, let me just

e19cf814-2aed-47a6-850f-626bf3637ac5-1
00:19:56.097 --> 00:19:58.300
open it and I will re share my
screen.

98e9b001-45d6-4e18-81b3-71e1864e45c3-0
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.480
Because there's potentially
those um.

56d9790d-cd24-40d9-8df6-4ebaeb6a147e-0
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.692
I think that was the, was it the
top five, top ten that we could

56d9790d-cd24-40d9-8df6-4ebaeb6a147e-1
00:20:06.692 --> 00:20:09.707
drill into as well. We've got
some designs for that, so be

56d9790d-cd24-40d9-8df6-4ebaeb6a147e-2
00:20:09.707 --> 00:20:11.650
good to get Belinda's thoughts
on it.

a2aa7b9b-520b-4bb0-8d81-62a35b839ef9-0
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.450
Yes, definitely. It's always
better to.

a6960c2d-0919-4cf1-9b41-0d2647782523-0
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.459
To show, but yes as I'm Keith
said designs at the moment so

a6960c2d-0919-4cf1-9b41-0d2647782523-1
00:20:19.459 --> 00:20:23.442
things can change here, but
Linda um, this is what we are

a6960c2d-0919-4cf1-9b41-0d2647782523-2
00:20:23.442 --> 00:20:25.090
thinking in terms of um.

bd5bd958-ac8a-460c-aa93-6d9a000e8513-0
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.675
What's the high level indication
page would look like? You can

bd5bd958-ac8a-460c-aa93-6d9a000e8513-1
00:20:29.675 --> 00:20:33.116
see there is a graph at the
bottom that you can change the

bd5bd958-ac8a-460c-aa93-6d9a000e8513-2
00:20:33.116 --> 00:20:34.050
view of as well.

18e1749c-1957-4c09-a583-de7a4d4bb299-0
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.440
Umm.

a0829b93-2778-4f4e-be6d-df6aafa4fc5b-0
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.840
And then, um, that's not the.

b245c108-9da7-441c-ac87-c2f30934979f-0
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.540
Thick matutu?

ea0bb830-b670-4595-adc4-8bb788f57e6f-0
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.660
Those nodes.

8c64af5e-7dae-48f3-bdf7-6d0f3043e7f6-0
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.825
About this was the one, so then
there is also another one with

8c64af5e-7dae-48f3-bdf7-6d0f3043e7f6-1
00:20:52.825 --> 00:20:56.687
the high level KPI's Ankit maybe
you've got it open, I can't seem

8c64af5e-7dae-48f3-bdf7-6d0f3043e7f6-2
00:20:56.687 --> 00:20:58.150
to find it at the moment.

96e59df9-7145-4cba-a8b7-b638dce6ee3d-0
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.620
Don't, but I can get it.

ac5259fa-310b-48c6-b21f-97824c518e74-0
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.980
But just let me try again.

a4c36268-f3b5-4387-a59a-9381c5653f85-0
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.832
Linda, do you ever access any of
these, this kind of data on a

a4c36268-f3b5-4387-a59a-9381c5653f85-1
00:21:18.832 --> 00:21:21.790
remote device or do you ever
have the need for it?

4af5dd12-1f27-40ba-902a-5af8c86128ab-0
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.493
On a remote device? No, not
really, just because of my own

4af5dd12-1f27-40ba-902a-5af8c86128ab-1
00:21:27.493 --> 00:21:31.647
working situation. Now that's
not to say that people other

4af5dd12-1f27-40ba-902a-5af8c86128ab-2
00:21:31.647 --> 00:21:35.871
people wouldn't within the
company, but from my own working

4af5dd12-1f27-40ba-902a-5af8c86128ab-3
00:21:35.871 --> 00:21:39.110
situation though, I don't really
need to, OK?

90379191-21fe-45a8-8bf0-4c416997c380-0
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.849
It's helpful to know, ma'am. I'm
just gonna send you the link for

90379191-21fe-45a8-8bf0-4c416997c380-1
00:21:45.849 --> 00:21:46.620
this other one.

5ffb35ec-4498-4e48-92cc-d286d47e8b35-0
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.905
I think it's opening, but it's
very slow today. Apologies.

5ffb35ec-4498-4e48-92cc-d286d47e8b35-1
00:21:52.905 --> 00:21:57.118
That's OK. I think. I think it
is generally, I've just been on

5ffb35ec-4498-4e48-92cc-d286d47e8b35-2
00:21:57.118 --> 00:22:01.130
another call and the whole
system has been really slow too.

5ffb35ec-4498-4e48-92cc-d286d47e8b35-3
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:05.210
So maybe not just you guys,
because Monday isn't it exactly.

d363c934-2e31-4f8f-85fa-c13605395302-0
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.490
OK. Thank you. I think I've.

8609d67d-9515-407e-a302-a0c1d48d7826-0
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:12.970
Have you got it?

ea582016-6a7e-416d-b71c-a259e59f6a17-0
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.530
I've been having issues with.

0c53b006-d8e9-4286-8c4c-a36ea0b0f2f9-0
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.280
Access today. But why? Why? Why?
It's opening, so we're with.

1eb32bdd-6ec0-4851-80c6-d7d0347e9216-0
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.430
Umm.

2d67b60a-6a38-4dc3-8135-45d142bf1375-0
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.580
No, that's the same one that
I've opened earlier.

f2150f38-6052-4439-b107-dbab08dffe0a-0
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:35.900
Umm.

f14806bb-aa80-4955-b7b3-fd26db8f2fc8-0
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.580
Bear with me, ohh sorry. Got it
now.

2a3d92f7-2a7b-496e-946e-9357694d5e08-0
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:46.072
Sorry, Belinda. OK, apologies.
OK, so this is it and this is

2a3d92f7-2a7b-496e-946e-9357694d5e08-1
00:22:46.072 --> 00:22:46.450
the.

51cd8350-4f19-40be-820f-6f5bb74060f7-0
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.141
Level 2 indication, so a little
data map here that shows you

51cd8350-4f19-40be-820f-6f5bb74060f7-1
00:22:51.141 --> 00:22:55.171
where you are when it comes to
evaluate indication tree. So you

51cd8350-4f19-40be-820f-6f5bb74060f7-2
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:59.076
can go more granular within that
indication or if you want to

51cd8350-4f19-40be-820f-6f5bb74060f7-3
00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:00.210
look at the whole.

41adbbf4-1b05-4815-8f43-4dec722d0007-0
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.908
Blood, then that's also an
option, um. And then of course,

41adbbf4-1b05-4815-8f43-4dec722d0007-1
00:23:05.908 --> 00:23:10.436
as we mentioned, you know, the
uh, number of drugs, different

41adbbf4-1b05-4815-8f43-4dec722d0007-2
00:23:10.436 --> 00:23:13.650
stages of development, um,
depending on um.

38b4c198-5f4d-428f-ae31-32031fdbefdf-0
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.939
On the indication as well. And
then also the idea is for you to

38b4c198-5f4d-428f-ae31-32031fdbefdf-1
00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:25.077
be able to manipulate your um
sales um prediction to show only

38b4c198-5f4d-428f-ae31-32031fdbefdf-2
00:23:25.077 --> 00:23:29.400
your the the time range that's
relevant to yourself.

f8f55991-ae75-4259-896d-1416b1a15971-0
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:37.280
And then the KPI so the the the
top drugs um as well.

a57ff7b8-56f1-4663-b9d8-f3c0b1c04315-0
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.775
And then you can also filter and
show slightly more or less

a57ff7b8-56f1-4663-b9d8-f3c0b1c04315-1
00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:47.070
however you want to um. However
you want to look at the UM.

8fc7b101-ffa4-4d48-b653-b4440ceb1636-0
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.590
At different um.

a4906ae1-9a98-413a-94de-8a3ebc881c81-0
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.010
Uh, at different um
classifications within the

a4906ae1-9a98-413a-94de-8a3ebc881c81-1
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.610
within that indication as well.

829ab1e9-2135-4161-a16d-e1362eb1a4c9-0
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.356
So then an uncle, please correct
me if I'm wrong. Once you do

829ab1e9-2135-4161-a16d-e1362eb1a4c9-1
00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:06.160
that, your report also filters
on whatever is relevant here.

9cc9cd2b-6c52-4868-9477-e7e77fe0daf4-0
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.054
Ohh no, sorry, apologies. It's
the idea is for this to be the

9cc9cd2b-6c52-4868-9477-e7e77fe0daf4-1
00:24:13.054 --> 00:24:16.949
reverse. So as you manipulate
your report here, then the high

9cc9cd2b-6c52-4868-9477-e7e77fe0daf4-2
00:24:16.949 --> 00:24:20.529
level analysis also shows
whatever you're interested in,

9cc9cd2b-6c52-4868-9477-e7e77fe0daf4-3
00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:24.298
whatever you've filtered your
report on. OK, so that's the,

9cc9cd2b-6c52-4868-9477-e7e77fe0daf4-4
00:24:24.298 --> 00:24:28.193
that's the thinking. So. So it
was the other way around, yes,

9cc9cd2b-6c52-4868-9477-e7e77fe0daf4-5
00:24:28.193 --> 00:24:30.580
same with the index page as
well. So.

350ceff4-9093-4d53-a115-108cb24502c1-0
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.997
Back to first showed you, when
you go in and you sort of see

350ceff4-9093-4d53-a115-108cb24502c1-1
00:24:34.997 --> 00:24:38.207
the calculated metrics and you
see the events and your top

350ceff4-9093-4d53-a115-108cb24502c1-2
00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:41.579
three. So the idea is as you
sort of manipulate your data via

350ceff4-9093-4d53-a115-108cb24502c1-3
00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:45.006
managed columns or filters, um
all of your metrics and all the

350ceff4-9093-4d53-a115-108cb24502c1-4
00:24:45.006 --> 00:24:47.780
information sort of the top half
will then update.

60b73803-f4eb-4acd-8dc6-bfbb50a14ed3-0
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.300
Exactly. All right. Got. Yeah.

5a0fd949-aa8e-46f5-8e39-3359fbcebebd-0
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.170
Yeah, that's useful. That is
really useful.

a00a8d80-f721-4596-bad3-53b39948d1c5-0
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.440
To uh say and to know.

176e019f-1c73-4940-b945-d079c23459ea-0
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.760
That it is doing that.

1fb3fba9-93ce-4a93-bb96-11ee9e18bd04-0
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.080
Because that.

e77344c4-c4f4-47c4-b209-009cb5693fe9-0
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.031
Yeah. So it's it's some
something that sometimes you

e77344c4-c4f4-47c4-b209-009cb5693fe9-1
00:25:07.031 --> 00:25:10.195
have to, you have to dig deep
into the report to find it,

e77344c4-c4f4-47c4-b209-009cb5693fe9-2
00:25:10.195 --> 00:25:13.633
don't you? So to have it there,
up there in front, in front of

e77344c4-c4f4-47c4-b209-009cb5693fe9-3
00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:15.870
you is, is, is great. Yeah, very
useful.

541e3a4c-facb-41ea-b356-dfef98efa875-0
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.677
Oh, and do you export much to do
you would you normally

541e3a4c-facb-41ea-b356-dfef98efa875-1
00:25:20.677 --> 00:25:24.406
manipulate your data then yeah,
sort it out or do you kind of

541e3a4c-facb-41ea-b356-dfef98efa875-2
00:25:24.406 --> 00:25:28.074
just yes, because I'm sharing
with a number of people and to

541e3a4c-facb-41ea-b356-dfef98efa875-3
00:25:28.074 --> 00:25:30.600
be honest, it's the easiest way
to share.

3f64fc2a-795d-480f-a799-76b305299b9d-0
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.905
Cool. So should we maybe just
show? So at the minute, what

3f64fc2a-795d-480f-a799-76b305299b9d-1
00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:40.852
we've basically built is the
ability to export and it'll just

3f64fc2a-795d-480f-a799-76b305299b9d-2
00:25:40.852 --> 00:25:44.480
export the data as it is.
There's no, none of the fancy,

3f64fc2a-795d-480f-a799-76b305299b9d-3
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:44.990
sort of.

9ae58840-b8bb-403c-bd51-46ecf405e3bf-0
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.841
There's none of the fancy
options to sort of include data

9ae58840-b8bb-403c-bd51-46ecf405e3bf-1
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:53.583
definitions etc, but maybe if we
can. We've obviously built the

9ae58840-b8bb-403c-bd51-46ecf405e3bf-2
00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:56.564
basic functionality of
exporting, but is there any

9ae58840-b8bb-403c-bd51-46ecf405e3bf-3
00:25:56.564 --> 00:26:00.189
other requirements that you'd
have with regards to exporting?

16b00d51-83ca-4391-9987-1ac193520975-0
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.860


58064413-64d8-4495-b3ad-219d36e31abf-0
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.960
I mean, you've got this, the CSV
and the Excel formats at the

58064413-64d8-4495-b3ad-219d36e31abf-1
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.610
moment I guess if.

646bdc11-d701-47c4-86b3-f1f85f564f95-0
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.028
Um, I mean, I can take
screenshots of some of the

646bdc11-d701-47c4-86b3-f1f85f564f95-1
00:26:16.028 --> 00:26:20.625
visualizations if if need be,
but I don't know if there's sort

646bdc11-d701-47c4-86b3-f1f85f564f95-2
00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:23.690
of an option maybe to do like a
PDF type.

af8248d5-d697-4516-a8e3-559d70fca202-0
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.830
Export of visualization when
you've put the.

5ea91ea4-309b-4219-bde6-06f6ab8966da-0
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.151
Details in that you that it's
important to you for that

5ea91ea4-309b-4219-bde6-06f6ab8966da-1
00:26:33.151 --> 00:26:36.995
particular report and just just
as a thought just as an idea,

5ea91ea4-309b-4219-bde6-06f6ab8966da-2
00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:40.962
but I mean it's it's not the end
of the world if it if it can't

5ea91ea4-309b-4219-bde6-06f6ab8966da-3
00:26:40.962 --> 00:26:44.806
be because the the important
thing for us would be to get the

5ea91ea4-309b-4219-bde6-06f6ab8966da-4
00:26:44.806 --> 00:26:46.789
raw data out in in in the Excel.

a4a9236f-2ecf-4f44-8750-08f3f4a9ee72-0
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.466
OK, cool. Is that something that
you use in the current platform

a4a9236f-2ecf-4f44-8750-08f3f4a9ee72-1
00:26:51.466 --> 00:26:52.460
exporting to PDF?

0531b99b-edee-4d36-afb6-a8c5c52190ce-0
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.540
Uh, yes, sometimes. Sometimes.

388da534-ab81-4c3f-a63f-0ed55b3484f4-0
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.188
Sometimes, sometimes the
visualizations are great for

388da534-ab81-4c3f-a63f-0ed55b3484f4-1
00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:05.600
when you're just for quickly
seeing.

89c39a2e-e362-4341-883d-e97424f923ba-0
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.971
Um, the data in over time like
you were showing um for for

89c39a2e-e362-4341-883d-e97424f923ba-1
00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:15.614
someone else to be able to see
that kind of change over time in

89c39a2e-e362-4341-883d-e97424f923ba-2
00:27:15.614 --> 00:27:20.041
as a visual reference. Yeah. OK
cool. And the final question

89c39a2e-e362-4341-883d-e97424f923ba-3
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:24.176
from me um this one came
directly from our product owner

89c39a2e-e362-4341-883d-e97424f923ba-4
00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:28.820
is so these index pages that you
see. So if you scroll a little

89c39a2e-e362-4341-883d-e97424f923ba-5
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.174
bit down magnet you could see
that they're based around the

89c39a2e-e362-4341-883d-e97424f923ba-6
00:27:33.174 --> 00:27:37.020
generic name so you can click
into the generic name.

e20904f0-06af-4c2b-998e-1c9613ebbe35-0
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.680
You could get taken to a
separate page.

13c423a0-2e71-4413-be5e-d30fb1f1270f-0
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.227
Is that how you'd expect it?
Would you expect it to be based

13c423a0-2e71-4413-be5e-d30fb1f1270f-1
00:27:43.227 --> 00:27:46.915
around the generic name, or
would you expect it to be around

13c423a0-2e71-4413-be5e-d30fb1f1270f-2
00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.850
based around the product itself?

57ffee77-93ee-4c0f-a7db-0485ca9d5bda-0
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.597
Uh, what do you mean the actual
brand name? Yeah, the trade

57ffee77-93ee-4c0f-a7db-0485ca9d5bda-1
00:27:54.597 --> 00:27:58.255
name. No, I'd expect generic
name. I'd expect generic name.

57ffee77-93ee-4c0f-a7db-0485ca9d5bda-2
00:27:58.255 --> 00:28:02.034
Yeah, that's helpful to know.
Yeah. OK, cool. I think I'm out

57ffee77-93ee-4c0f-a7db-0485ca9d5bda-3
00:28:02.034 --> 00:28:05.814
of questions. That's been super,
super helpful. And I know we

57ffee77-93ee-4c0f-a7db-0485ca9d5bda-4
00:28:05.814 --> 00:28:09.594
have some time to spare as well.
Was there anything else that

57ffee77-93ee-4c0f-a7db-0485ca9d5bda-5
00:28:09.594 --> 00:28:11.240
you'd like to add, Belinda?

c551a7f5-6e31-4edf-91bb-98be684795e0-0
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.153
No, no, it's it's uh, it looks
like it's coming on really well.

c551a7f5-6e31-4edf-91bb-98be684795e0-1
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:18.380
Looking forward to when we can
use it.

a952e1e3-b4ae-4bce-9c58-645a9c5513e4-0
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.150
For sure.

64a6f277-879c-4a30-8681-e6ea17cbdc55-0
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.160
So I think I think it would make
a huge difference.

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-0
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.274
That's really good to hear. Um,
we'll pass on all the feedback

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-1
00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:32.182
to the team. And then as as
always, I mean you're pretty

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-2
00:28:32.182 --> 00:28:35.294
familiar with the process, we'll
look at all of the customer

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-3
00:28:35.294 --> 00:28:38.559
feedback. We'll then analyze it,
assess it, summarize it. We'll

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-4
00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:41.875
come back to you in the sort of
next few weeks and we'll let you

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-5
00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:44.732
know exactly what all other
customers have said and how

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-6
00:28:44.732 --> 00:28:47.793
we're going to kind of address
that moving forwards. I will

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-7
00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:50.701
follow up the call with an
e-mail like I always do, just

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-8
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:54.068
some instructions on how to test
yourself and so if you can go in

ba1708df-8bf7-4d7f-b78b-1e33c27fbc34-9
00:28:54.068 --> 00:28:55.650
the platform and test yourself.

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-0
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.880
I know you have done previously.
That would also be very helpful.

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-1
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.515
Um, there is a couple of
options. When you go into the

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-2
00:29:01.515 --> 00:29:04.053
platform, you can either
complete a survey so you're

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-3
00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:07.214
again familiar with that. That's
got around 15 to 20 questions on

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-4
00:29:07.214 --> 00:29:10.040
specific features. But there's
also an option just to give

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-5
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.105
feedback. So if you didn't want
to go through the whole survey,

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-6
00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:16.074
but you've picked up specific
things and then just choose the

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-7
00:29:16.074 --> 00:29:18.948
give feedback option and then
you could literally just type

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-8
00:29:18.948 --> 00:29:21.965
what you want and press submit
so you don't have to go through

00875694-7e8a-4daf-b6fe-81ca27c125df-9
00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:22.780
the whole survey.

bfc1ec96-38d6-4faf-bd82-a03e0e3816fb-0
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.339
Um, but yeah, I'll follow up in
e-mail. So it'll, it'll be sort

bfc1ec96-38d6-4faf-bd82-a03e0e3816fb-1
00:29:27.339 --> 00:29:30.380
of all clear in the e-mail. But
yeah, if there's, if there's

bfc1ec96-38d6-4faf-bd82-a03e0e3816fb-2
00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.470
nothing else, we will. We'll
close the call for now and we'll

bfc1ec96-38d6-4faf-bd82-a03e0e3816fb-3
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.311
be sure to reach out next time
we're ready for some more

bfc1ec96-38d6-4faf-bd82-a03e0e3816fb-4
00:29:36.311 --> 00:29:36.710
testing.

9e6d5741-acff-4a31-81e1-f74cd257f675-0
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.419
Sounds good. Thank you very
much. Cool. Perfect. Well, hope

9e6d5741-acff-4a31-81e1-f74cd257f675-1
00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:45.506
you enjoy the rest of your day.
Alright. Yes, you too. Thank

9e6d5741-acff-4a31-81e1-f74cd257f675-2
00:29:45.506 --> 00:29:46.980
you, Belinda. Bye bye.
