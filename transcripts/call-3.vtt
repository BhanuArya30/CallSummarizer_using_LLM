95b08182-2301-48f1-884d-66b5e5a1f273-0
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.180
OK, cool.

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-0
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.053
Um, so as a as, as sort of in
terms of the homepage, you've

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-1
00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:12.312
kind of seen a lot of this. The
If you, if you need me to zoom

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-2
00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:15.622
in at any point, just just feel
free and feel free to button at

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-3
00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:18.571
any point as well. Just, you
know, think out loud. Be as

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-4
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.778
honest as you can. Don't feel
like you need to wait for me to

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-5
00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:24.726
stop. Just just completely
interrupt me. That's fine. So

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-6
00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:27.520
the only things that have
changed on the home page is

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-7
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.210
we've made this a little
smaller. This used to be 2

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.624
buttons and we've just made that
larger. So it's just to create a

27a8470c-9bdf-4851-823e-426b1e4d780c-9
00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:35.899
new report straight from there.
We've also.

7fd3094d-04a9-45c2-adc7-56b59cdc3db6-0
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.664
Added in saved reports this time
so I'll show you how to save a

7fd3094d-04a9-45c2-adc7-56b59cdc3db6-1
00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.946
report but once you've saved
your report you can now see

7fd3094d-04a9-45c2-adc7-56b59cdc3db6-2
00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:46.573
those on the home page and if
you click on yes. So this is one

7fd3094d-04a9-45c2-adc7-56b59cdc3db6-3
00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:50.085
that I did I think on Friday. So
if I click into that report

7fd3094d-04a9-45c2-adc7-56b59cdc3db6-4
00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:53.827
it'll it'll take you straight to
that report. And what you could

7fd3094d-04a9-45c2-adc7-56b59cdc3db6-5
00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:57.339
also do is you've got this my
saved here in this sort of top

7fd3094d-04a9-45c2-adc7-56b59cdc3db6-6
00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:57.800
NAV bar.

464bfabd-49ae-4b89-a5a5-60cfc3179abd-0
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.510
Um, so you can access them there
as well. So that's something

464bfabd-49ae-4b89-a5a5-60cfc3179abd-1
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.195
that we've added to the home
page. Everything else on the

464bfabd-49ae-4b89-a5a5-60cfc3179abd-2
00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:06.510
home page is the same as what
you've seen before.

b4e573ad-ff0b-440b-86b1-8c380e108ba1-0
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.098
Do you have any feedback on that
initially in terms of having

b4e573ad-ff0b-440b-86b1-8c380e108ba1-1
00:01:11.098 --> 00:01:12.870
your saved reports on the home
page?

943a79d4-ca3f-49d6-8c13-6dd77ccfb1d5-0
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.371
Now I have a question. So right
now on the old platform, I go to

943a79d4-ca3f-49d6-8c13-6dd77ccfb1d5-1
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:23.147
manage reports. I scroll to the
folder where the report is that

943a79d4-ca3f-49d6-8c13-6dd77ccfb1d5-2
00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:23.670
I want.

c740d40d-d169-4d46-9e4a-c6668ebada54-0
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130
Because I can see other people's
folders.

4ec730cd-644a-444e-8b7d-f28a338056fb-0
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.045
So my first question is, am I
still going to have access to

4ec730cd-644a-444e-8b7d-f28a338056fb-1
00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:34.300
reports that are in other
people's folders?

816c2788-d93e-4940-9287-9460be340d0d-0
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.540
And then secondly, when I'm in
manage reports.

db9aafa3-ebef-4556-b8ee-ddc223d0789a-0
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.641
I pick a report, you know, maybe
it's just a matter of I don't

db9aafa3-ebef-4556-b8ee-ddc223d0789a-1
00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:46.055
want to edit it, I just want to
run it because I need to update

db9aafa3-ebef-4556-b8ee-ddc223d0789a-2
00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.203
it, and then I want to run
another saved report I actually

db9aafa3-ebef-4556-b8ee-ddc223d0789a-3
00:01:49.203 --> 00:01:49.630
have to.

5608864c-56c6-4993-b9f4-ba3b9c09cbf0-0
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.326
Like kind of go out and come
back in. Because if I if I click

5608864c-56c6-4993-b9f4-ba3b9c09cbf0-1
00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:57.787
another report while I'm in
that, you know, after I run one

5608864c-56c6-4993-b9f4-ba3b9c09cbf0-2
00:01:57.787 --> 00:02:01.363
that I've saved, it doesn't. It
makes me go out and come back

5608864c-56c6-4993-b9f4-ba3b9c09cbf0-3
00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:05.055
in, not out of the platform. But
I have to go back, pick manage

5608864c-56c6-4993-b9f4-ba3b9c09cbf0-4
00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:08.458
reports again, go back to the
folder. So I don't know that

5608864c-56c6-4993-b9f4-ba3b9c09cbf0-5
00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:11.977
this looks like this might be
better and I just want to make

5608864c-56c6-4993-b9f4-ba3b9c09cbf0-6
00:02:11.977 --> 00:02:14.400
sure I can see reports and other
folders.

e4481cb1-6fdf-467d-aad0-a166fa73cb9e-0
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.350
Nick, do you wanna shed some
light on that one?

6eb952c9-c98c-4c1d-8b9a-a0487e513d37-0
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.350
You will, yes.

392fafcd-388c-4bfb-91c4-40ff131d85ff-0
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.570
OK.

94a239ff-8c6a-4031-a67f-fc300ec211e5-0
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.264
There you go. Um, so at the
minute we've only built the

94a239ff-8c6a-4031-a67f-fc300ec211e5-1
00:02:26.264 --> 00:02:29.502
functionality just to save a
report, so you can't even rename

94a239ff-8c6a-4031-a67f-fc300ec211e5-2
00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:32.792
them or anything like that. It's
just the start of a 10th. But

94a239ff-8c6a-4031-a67f-fc300ec211e5-3
00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:35.560
yeah, the additional
functionality will be coming in

94a239ff-8c6a-4031-a67f-fc300ec211e5-4
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.797
future releases, and no doubt we
will rely on you for testing

94a239ff-8c6a-4031-a67f-fc300ec211e5-5
00:02:38.797 --> 00:02:39.790
those bits as well.

af3fc9d7-d50e-4c98-8edb-cb74f282e9d5-0
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.721
So this is all the same, still
got search function, we've only

af3fc9d7-d50e-4c98-8edb-cb74f282e9d5-1
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:47.611
got still got three report
templates. You can see the

af3fc9d7-d50e-4c98-8edb-cb74f282e9d5-2
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:50.930
preview on the right, let's just
go into drugs create report.

633c3a99-bee4-434d-87ca-67b55ebb0b97-0
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.486
We could show you this sort of
the the new bits to this page.

633c3a99-bee4-434d-87ca-67b55ebb0b97-1
00:02:56.486 --> 00:03:00.315
As you see in last time it loads
a data table. So there's quite a

633c3a99-bee4-434d-87ca-67b55ebb0b97-2
00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:03.970
few things that have changed on
this page. First things first,

633c3a99-bee4-434d-87ca-67b55ebb0b97-3
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.218
in managed columns, this is
exactly how you saw it last

633c3a99-bee4-434d-87ca-67b55ebb0b97-4
00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:10.757
time. But what we've done is
we've got a sort of a hierarchy

633c3a99-bee4-434d-87ca-67b55ebb0b97-5
00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.541
for everything. So for example
you could see 31

633c3a99-bee4-434d-87ca-67b55ebb0b97-6
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.470
classifications.

035d29c3-1a9e-47bf-9203-302604027cba-0
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.834
You could drill down further.
Um, you could select what you

035d29c3-1a9e-47bf-9203-302604027cba-1
00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:20.539
want to regardless of how many
options there are. You could

035d29c3-1a9e-47bf-9203-302604027cba-2
00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.379
always browse. You don't always
have to search, you can search

035d29c3-1a9e-47bf-9203-302604027cba-3
00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.920
if you want.

b77d2feb-5083-407d-b008-97c546754d60-0
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.585
Um, that's the only thing that's
changed there since last time,

b77d2feb-5083-407d-b008-97c546754d60-1
00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:30.307
and we've just made the drachen
drop a little more obvious. So

b77d2feb-5083-407d-b008-97c546754d60-2
00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:33.073
before you could drag and drop
and you know it wasn't as clear,

b77d2feb-5083-407d-b008-97c546754d60-3
00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:35.666
but it's now you if you're
dragging and dropping something,

b77d2feb-5083-407d-b008-97c546754d60-4
00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:37.869
you could see sort of a bit of a
shadow around it.

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-0
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.757
Um, so just to make it a bit
more clearer, that's the only

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-1
00:03:41.757 --> 00:03:45.170
bits that I've changed in terms
of managed columns. Filters have

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-2
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.953
moved. Now the last time we
spoke filters, you had a

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-3
00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:51.261
separate blue button here, um
with filters, and then you click

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-4
00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:54.358
for that and then you could
apply a filter. Now what we've

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-5
00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:57.509
done here is we've embedded it
into a 3 dot menu. So if you

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-6
00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.606
hover over any column header,
you can see these three dots

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-7
00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:03.967
that are there. So let's say for
example, company, if you click

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-8
00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:06.959
on those three dots, that's
where you've got your column

229c45b7-c71a-43c8-ba77-128c394d4d73-9
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.430
options, so you've got sort.

571da3bf-d2b9-4ffa-b500-b9dd9d540c62-0
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.382
Um, adding a filter? And you
could also pin the column to the

571da3bf-d2b9-4ffa-b500-b9dd9d540c62-1
00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:11.600
left.

5db26378-dd68-4e44-b333-9d1a83027302-0
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.400
So let's just increase the
number of rows here.

4113bb70-8800-4542-b957-f85a8125654c-0
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.836
So two things there. Yeah you
could. It automatically freezes

4113bb70-8800-4542-b957-f85a8125654c-1
00:04:22.836 --> 00:04:26.124
the header, so regardless of how
once you Scroll down, that will

4113bb70-8800-4542-b957-f85a8125654c-2
00:04:26.124 --> 00:04:29.007
always freeze. And then if I
want to pin a column to the

4113bb70-8800-4542-b957-f85a8125654c-3
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:32.093
left, if I click pin and then
that, that company will always

4113bb70-8800-4542-b957-f85a8125654c-4
00:04:32.093 --> 00:04:35.280
stay to the left regardless of
how much I scroll to the right.

15b7d4dc-4fde-44ab-bd80-09bbd9019cb4-0
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.780
So that's something that we've
added this time, the filters.

c6d7c517-14ff-49b1-93fe-8a3e67287c11-0
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.441
In the general have stayed the
same and it's just the

c6d7c517-14ff-49b1-93fe-8a3e67287c11-1
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:44.870
positioning we have added little
things like.

f59abc4c-ccb5-4f5a-ac23-282105edb283-0
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.879
Um, you've got a search bar,
you've got what we had last time

f59abc4c-ccb5-4f5a-ac23-282105edb283-1
00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.308
is you could browse things, but
if they had more than 100 values

f59abc4c-ccb5-4f5a-ac23-282105edb283-2
00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:55.472
in them then you could only
search. We've changed that now.

f59abc4c-ccb5-4f5a-ac23-282105edb283-3
00:04:55.472 --> 00:04:58.425
So a lot of the feedback last
time was I still want the

f59abc4c-ccb5-4f5a-ac23-282105edb283-4
00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:01.537
ability to browse, so that's
fine. We've basically changed

f59abc4c-ccb5-4f5a-ac23-282105edb283-5
00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:03.700
that. We've given the ability to
browse.

3e1f5b8c-def9-47b3-82b9-9228e51bf9ba-0
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.290
Um.

cc60b334-c8c7-4762-bccb-518731a913a2-0
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.419
We've not got all of the data
within the platform at the

cc60b334-c8c7-4762-bccb-518731a913a2-1
00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.061
moment, which is why you're
going to see a few empty cells.

cc60b334-c8c7-4762-bccb-518731a913a2-2
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.659
The team are working on that.
That's nothing to be alarmed

cc60b334-c8c7-4762-bccb-518731a913a2-3
00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:15.539
about at the moment.

0a9ac7a3-2803-4a3a-93e7-da725d987ca0-0
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.665
Um, so yeah, there's the filters
have naturally stayed the same.

0a9ac7a3-2803-4a3a-93e7-da725d987ca0-1
00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:22.334
We've just made a few
enhancements in terms of the,

0a9ac7a3-2803-4a3a-93e7-da725d987ca0-2
00:05:22.334 --> 00:05:25.259
you know, more than 100 values
you can still browse. Um.

af6ea893-f423-4ec1-b777-c3a55ad1a1ac-0
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.938
You can now export. This is
something that you weren't able

af6ea893-f423-4ec1-b777-c3a55ad1a1ac-1
00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:30.790
to do last time, so if I was to
press.

1721ba63-59c2-443b-b01e-80e839c5c5d8-0
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.244
Excel at the moment there is a
couple of performance issues, so

1721ba63-59c2-443b-b01e-80e839c5c5d8-1
00:05:34.244 --> 00:05:37.143
it takes a few seconds for it to
acknowledge that you've clicked

1721ba63-59c2-443b-b01e-80e839c5c5d8-2
00:05:37.143 --> 00:05:39.641
the button and for it to
download. And once it's ready,

1721ba63-59c2-443b-b01e-80e839c5c5d8-3
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:42.228
I'll show you that. Because
it'll be good just to open up

1721ba63-59c2-443b-b01e-80e839c5c5d8-4
00:05:42.228 --> 00:05:44.859
the Excel and sort of show you
what's included in there as

1721ba63-59c2-443b-b01e-80e839c5c5d8-5
00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:47.090
well, just in case you have any
feedback on that.

bae65dfe-3f05-4a53-b406-4a3ac4b208b8-0
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.365
Um, you could also save the
report from this page. So that's

bae65dfe-3f05-4a53-b406-4a3ac4b208b8-1
00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:54.230
the export that we've just done.
We'll open in a SEC.

f2da846e-f504-4233-813a-c6d433dac19d-0
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.710
Um.

89a0bf21-c615-4ce7-a6d0-a3f061ab3097-0
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.307
If you want to save this view,
let's say for example you have.

89a0bf21-c615-4ce7-a6d0-a3f061ab3097-1
00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:03.748
You know, added certain filters,
you've you've changed a few of

89a0bf21-c615-4ce7-a6d0-a3f061ab3097-2
00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:07.028
those columns around, changed
the order. If you then want to

89a0bf21-c615-4ce7-a6d0-a3f061ab3097-3
00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:10.040
save it, you've got the save
icon, click save and then.

2b943e95-b38f-4fb6-85b0-a5cafd4e9459-0
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.453
As it is, you could then access
it from my saved. So if you go

2b943e95-b38f-4fb6-85b0-a5cafd4e9459-1
00:06:14.453 --> 00:06:18.082
into here you can see you've not
got the ability to rename at the

2b943e95-b38f-4fb6-85b0-a5cafd4e9459-2
00:06:18.082 --> 00:06:21.161
minute, so it just saves it as
default. You've got some

2b943e95-b38f-4fb6-85b0-a5cafd4e9459-3
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:24.515
information here in terms of
metadata, the date, time, where

2b943e95-b38f-4fb6-85b0-a5cafd4e9459-4
00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:27.210
it's saved from and how many
columns you've got.

ace40ca0-1ef2-440f-a0da-04d037cd4b71-0
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.755
So if you click it, it'll just
take you straight back into that

ace40ca0-1ef2-440f-a0da-04d037cd4b71-1
00:06:30.755 --> 00:06:33.487
report. Um, same on the home
page as well. If you click it,

ace40ca0-1ef2-440f-a0da-04d037cd4b71-2
00:06:33.487 --> 00:06:35.992
it'll take you straight back
into that report, um. And

ace40ca0-1ef2-440f-a0da-04d037cd4b71-3
00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:38.907
something that we had last time
as well was just resetting this

ace40ca0-1ef2-440f-a0da-04d037cd4b71-4
00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:39.910
table back to default.

28648ae5-35dc-4a51-900e-50a166af64df-0
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.899
Um, so you can do that as well.
So yeah, quite a bit of changes

28648ae5-35dc-4a51-900e-50a166af64df-1
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:46.500
in terms of your filters, your
exports are saved.

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-0
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.967
Any feedback on that? Yeah, so
when you export, I mean I get

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-1
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:54.484
you're building a report, so
obviously you have the fields

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-2
00:06:54.484 --> 00:06:58.002
that you want because you're
picking and choosing what you

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-3
00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:01.759
want on that report. But say you
know you have this report and

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-4
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:05.515
you have all these columns and
you want to kind of you want to

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-5
00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:08.854
export just a subset of the
columns, you don't want the

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-6
00:07:08.854 --> 00:07:12.431
whole report. When you export,
will you have the ability to

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-7
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.949
pick the the columns that you
want to export or you export

86fc4aa6-706b-434e-9941-5ed4e12ac6da-8
00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:17.500
whatever is in the report?

dc14c75a-b00c-41c6-a14e-c31cee555da1-0
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.090
That's a good question, Nick.

9e70f615-6c2a-4010-9e3a-e3b4de75c106-0
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.361
Yeah, I think, I think the idea
is that effectively what you're

9e70f615-6c2a-4010-9e3a-e3b4de75c106-1
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:24.570
doing.

d8bb0742-5a4a-4283-877b-90d3d5c50640-0
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.090
In this view as you're picking
the columns.

6c8e181b-1cc1-4632-acf3-539b7cd01ed0-0
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.353
That you would export
essentially, so there would be

6c8e181b-1cc1-4632-acf3-539b7cd01ed0-1
00:07:30.353 --> 00:07:32.310
no additional step. Effectively
it would be this.

285f5fd0-c92a-4326-a7da-660b6a6de732-0
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.790
OK.

ba2d6571-f2b0-471d-acce-5cface88fe48-0
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.489
So I guess, yeah, you would
manage your columns there.

ba2d6571-f2b0-471d-acce-5cface88fe48-1
00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:42.271
Anything that you want to get
rid of, you could just remove

ba2d6571-f2b0-471d-acce-5cface88fe48-2
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:45.006
and then when you're ready to
export, it would just export

ba2d6571-f2b0-471d-acce-5cface88fe48-3
00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.602
those columns that are.
Sometimes what I do is I'll run

ba2d6571-f2b0-471d-acce-5cface88fe48-4
00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:50.476
a report and it's for a certain
purpose and then someone else

ba2d6571-f2b0-471d-acce-5cface88fe48-5
00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:53.165
will ask me a question and I'm
like, oh, I already have a

ba2d6571-f2b0-471d-acce-5cface88fe48-6
00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:53.490
report.

f8b42d0c-16ee-4eaa-9493-ab6e07243b38-0
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.141
Now you know, maybe it's
something I just ran, for

f8b42d0c-16ee-4eaa-9493-ab6e07243b38-1
00:07:57.141 --> 00:08:00.908
example, and I'll open excel and
then I'll get rid of the columns

f8b42d0c-16ee-4eaa-9493-ab6e07243b38-2
00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:04.562
in Excel that I don't think that
person needs rather than going

f8b42d0c-16ee-4eaa-9493-ab6e07243b38-3
00:08:04.562 --> 00:08:08.158
in and rerunning another report
and altering it and saving it.

f8b42d0c-16ee-4eaa-9493-ab6e07243b38-4
00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:11.126
So that's why I asked the
question, no, that that's

f8b42d0c-16ee-4eaa-9493-ab6e07243b38-5
00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:12.039
perfectly valid.

bcdfb7eb-f96b-425b-aa01-e76cdfdc1fb2-0
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.685
I'm I'm fine with what you've
done here, but that's why the

bcdfb7eb-f96b-425b-aa01-e76cdfdc1fb2-1
00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:20.271
question came up. OK. Thank you
for that. So let's, let's open

bcdfb7eb-f96b-425b-aa01-e76cdfdc1fb2-2
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:23.686
this export and then I will
maybe just ask for your general

bcdfb7eb-f96b-425b-aa01-e76cdfdc1fb2-3
00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:27.329
feedback on what you've seen in
terms of the save, the exports,

bcdfb7eb-f96b-425b-aa01-e76cdfdc1fb2-4
00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:28.980
the pinning, the column, the.

45682219-a660-4bee-96df-88b315d29856-0
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.440
Um, the three dot menu.

a8d9d4ce-9aec-4d5b-ba56-b290350c2576-0
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.020
What's happens?

83d2b8bd-6205-455a-a507-8794a69c5bdd-0
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.120
Go.

10c61a5c-eb2f-4b74-b6a5-0acae1af7db7-0
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.820
Oh, it's gonna absolutely huge.

b407176f-0f61-4b95-9d19-1c6a5aa483a0-0
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.611
Um, so yeah, that that's the
view once you export it is

b407176f-0f61-4b95-9d19-1c6a5aa483a0-1
00:09:00.611 --> 00:09:03.510
there, do you have any any
feedback on that in particular?

787cb4ba-44d7-4a6c-9087-70fefaa9362b-0
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.260
Yeah, I think it's fine. I mean
the reports now.

b988f372-c917-474f-b489-bbb251fb2719-0
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.010
The Excel file just looks a
little bit nicer I think.

ec91b0f5-7e55-4948-b8f6-b7bce44ae8eb-0
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.480
Umm.

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-0
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.917
But otherwise, I mean this is
fine, this is functional. So OK,

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-1
00:09:20.917 --> 00:09:24.723
that's fine and thank you for
that. So anything else in terms

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-2
00:09:24.723 --> 00:09:28.467
of the, the other things I've
shown, I know you've obviously

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-3
00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:32.335
seen the last release so there's
not huge amounts, but any any

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-4
00:09:32.335 --> 00:09:35.895
sort of views on the three dot
menu, how would you access

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-5
00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:39.885
filters, the ability to save or
report anything in particular or

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-6
00:09:39.885 --> 00:09:43.691
I think I like the three dot
menu, I'm used to doing that and

e1bbab4b-286a-4cbb-a251-f029d8e7c003-7
00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:44.059
other.

f9ff87b1-9632-4948-8708-efeffacf0aaf-0
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.015
That and other in other sources
and even in our internal CI we

f9ff87b1-9632-4948-8708-efeffacf0aaf-1
00:09:50.015 --> 00:09:51.720
have that functionality.

2fad3f3a-f60c-46d4-baa6-09729db283a0-0
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.830
I think it's easier now having
everything in that little menu.

f89d8724-11c0-46dd-81fa-7f2228ff7c36-0
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.863
No, I think it looks good. I
think it looks good. I like

f89d8724-11c0-46dd-81fa-7f2228ff7c36-1
00:10:01.863 --> 00:10:05.370
being able to export right from
here, so I think it looks good.

93800475-a133-48be-b103-75969d27f465-0
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.552
Yeah, that is good to hear. So
search the search bar still not

93800475-a133-48be-b103-75969d27f465-1
00:10:10.552 --> 00:10:14.136
working. So we can't test that
the minute, but what we can do

93800475-a133-48be-b103-75969d27f465-2
00:10:14.136 --> 00:10:17.373
is we can go into the data
Explorer. So this will still

93800475-a133-48be-b103-75969d27f465-3
00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:21.015
active. The last time we spoke,
what we have done is I'll just

93800475-a133-48be-b103-75969d27f465-4
00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:24.773
show you. So there's still drugs
and companies, um, last time we

93800475-a133-48be-b103-75969d27f465-5
00:10:24.773 --> 00:10:26.970
spoke these were placeholder
metrics.

50171064-b0a7-4300-8755-d421b2ca7bde-0
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.859
Um, there were done. It was sort
of dummy data right now. They

50171064-b0a7-4300-8755-d421b2ca7bde-1
00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:33.050
calculated metrics. So we've
updated that.

c8ccdc01-655c-4077-ad3e-60dd3802c145-0
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.548
And we've also implemented the
same data table functionalities

c8ccdc01-655c-4077-ad3e-60dd3802c145-1
00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:40.080
on this page as well, so.

ca88d54c-c15b-4ad5-a662-5f17565f652c-0
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.691
Everything you seen before, the
three dot menu, the filters,

ca88d54c-c15b-4ad5-a662-5f17565f652c-1
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:48.432
export, save. You can also get
that on your overview page as

ca88d54c-c15b-4ad5-a662-5f17565f652c-2
00:10:48.432 --> 00:10:49.229
well. So any.

f28fd5a5-070e-4a7e-b79b-9df7a19198cf-0
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.930
Any additional feedback I guess
on this index page?

ccc3cf00-6bc7-495d-aded-756c38645952-0
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.044
No, I think it's fine. So the
overview page is what I can

ccc3cf00-6bc7-495d-aded-756c38645952-1
00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:03.399
create, right? So I have my own,
I can create my own overview

ccc3cf00-6bc7-495d-aded-756c38645952-2
00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:07.613
page or this is just what you
guys when I go in to evaluate

ccc3cf00-6bc7-495d-aded-756c38645952-3
00:11:07.613 --> 00:11:09.440
pharma that overview page?

9665e9d8-688c-4718-a73d-fa244c76dfc5-0
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.080
This would be the overview page
for all drugs. So this will be

9665e9d8-688c-4718-a73d-fa244c76dfc5-1
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.780
standard for anyone that comes
in. And then yeah, if you want

9665e9d8-688c-4718-a73d-fa244c76dfc5-2
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.660
to filter down. So at the moment
we don't have the ability to to

9665e9d8-688c-4718-a73d-fa244c76dfc5-3
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.764
sort of narrow down this
information, drill down or

9665e9d8-688c-4718-a73d-fa244c76dfc5-4
00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:29.464
filter and that will come in a
future release. So the idea is

9665e9d8-688c-4718-a73d-fa244c76dfc5-5
00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:33.225
that you can apply filters to
this data and then it will amend

9665e9d8-688c-4718-a73d-fa244c76dfc5-6
00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:36.090
this data, it will update the
data table below.

8199af78-25bb-47ff-9e57-766b09bb4791-0
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.935
OK. Because where I was, where I
was thinking say for example

8199af78-25bb-47ff-9e57-766b09bb4791-1
00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:45.156
like one of the things I do all
the time is you know, what's the

8199af78-25bb-47ff-9e57-766b09bb4791-2
00:11:45.156 --> 00:11:49.247
worldwide market or I do these
company rankings on the branded

8199af78-25bb-47ff-9e57-766b09bb4791-3
00:11:49.247 --> 00:11:53.207
market and right now, you know,
I I go to reports and I just

8199af78-25bb-47ff-9e57-766b09bb4791-4
00:11:53.207 --> 00:11:55.999
rerun the report to update it
and nothing.

944b48d7-f52b-4c2c-b3b1-a79d282114db-0
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.150
Usually ever changes in some of
those canned reports. I was

944b48d7-f52b-4c2c-b3b1-a79d282114db-1
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.960
thinking if I had the ability to
create my own, kind of.

2cdc30b8-0825-4001-af61-db8adb0631f7-0
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.730
I don't know landing page or you
know, my own overview page, the

2cdc30b8-0825-4001-af61-db8adb0631f7-1
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.630
things that I do the most.

3bfeb221-fb71-4161-b4c3-d5cbc86cc5fa-0
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.089
When I go into evaluate Pharma,
immediately I would see, you

3bfeb221-fb71-4161-b4c3-d5cbc86cc5fa-1
00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:20.544
know, the worldwide brand and
market or whatever I wanted to,

3bfeb221-fb71-4161-b4c3-d5cbc86cc5fa-2
00:12:20.544 --> 00:12:23.888
right? OK. So I think what
you're saying there is you'd be,

3bfeb221-fb71-4161-b4c3-d5cbc86cc5fa-3
00:12:23.888 --> 00:12:27.176
you'd want the ability to
customize this overview page, so

3bfeb221-fb71-4161-b4c3-d5cbc86cc5fa-4
00:12:27.176 --> 00:12:30.129
you could just add things that
are relevant for you.

657799f4-5577-4a9e-a660-a6fc877282f3-0
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.755
And then that's every time I go
in that's what I would see, what

657799f4-5577-4a9e-a660-a6fc877282f3-1
00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:37.983
you'd see. OK, that's, yeah,
that's interesting. Fine. Is, is

657799f4-5577-4a9e-a660-a6fc877282f3-2
00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:40.952
do you think this stuff is
relevant for yourself? So you

657799f4-5577-4a9e-a660-a6fc877282f3-3
00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:44.180
know your events and your top
three, so you've got moas, your

657799f4-5577-4a9e-a660-a6fc877282f3-4
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.565
indication level threes and your
therapeutic categories. Is that

657799f4-5577-4a9e-a660-a6fc877282f3-5
00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:50.638
of any help for you in terms of
this sort of middle of the

657799f4-5577-4a9e-a660-a6fc877282f3-6
00:12:50.638 --> 00:12:51.680
screen or would you?

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-0
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.914
As a matter of fact, your World
Preview just came out for 20,

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-1
00:12:57.914 --> 00:13:01.894
you know, after 2028 and there's
a an image in there. This time

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-2
00:13:01.894 --> 00:13:05.438
it's just top therapy areas.
Last time you kind of mixed

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-3
00:13:05.438 --> 00:13:09.168
therapy and subtherapeutic
categories. But I actually asked

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-4
00:13:09.168 --> 00:13:12.898
Anastasia to run me the data
that sat behind that because I

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-5
00:13:12.898 --> 00:13:16.940
get asked that all the time like
what are the top therapy areas.

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-6
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.795
So having some of that right on
the main page makes it really

d2f2eb2c-2a56-4535-9fa4-c5655103d004-7
00:13:20.795 --> 00:13:21.789
helpful because.

b533b45e-16f6-4ee3-81a1-6c819d024c40-0
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.766
And once I'm able to filter or
like this is top therapeutic

b533b45e-16f6-4ee3-81a1-6c819d024c40-1
00:13:25.766 --> 00:13:28.982
categories, you're showing
three. What if I wanted to see

b533b45e-16f6-4ee3-81a1-6c819d024c40-2
00:13:28.982 --> 00:13:31.809
the top ten, will I have the
ability to change to?

fe5c5f2c-040b-448d-ac09-60c8870010ca-0
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.060
Increase what you're showing,
you know what I mean?

1d197681-d2e1-47d3-8544-30164c80f8e2-0
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.658
Um, so that's interesting. I
think that's still in discovery.

1d197681-d2e1-47d3-8544-30164c80f8e2-1
00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:42.786
Nick, correct me if I'm wrong.
Um, the ability to drill down

1d197681-d2e1-47d3-8544-30164c80f8e2-2
00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:45.965
will be there. To what level? I
think we still need to define

1d197681-d2e1-47d3-8544-30164c80f8e2-3
00:13:45.965 --> 00:13:48.990
it, but I think Nick will be
better placed to answer that.

84b4cdca-c774-4bee-8c10-dc034dba287f-0
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.100
Generally speaking, there will
be greater aspects of

84b4cdca-c774-4bee-8c10-dc034dba287f-1
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.247
personalization available, but
at the moment I think it's uh,

84b4cdca-c774-4bee-8c10-dc034dba287f-2
00:13:57.247 --> 00:14:00.090
just, um, we can take your
feedback. Thank you on that.

b821d0cf-735a-49aa-a2ba-d2dc943a2c41-0
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.310
OK.

421c31e0-c9c4-4430-ad6b-5f4fe9e92050-0
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.690
Um, yeah, that's really
interesting actually. So.

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-0
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.065
The only other thing on the data
explorers is um slices. Now, we

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-1
00:14:12.065 --> 00:14:15.684
looked at this last time and
there's not, there's nothing

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-2
00:14:15.684 --> 00:14:19.428
much that's changed with regards
to the slices, the sort of

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-3
00:14:19.428 --> 00:14:23.546
curated data views, um, But what
I wanted to get your opinions on

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-4
00:14:23.546 --> 00:14:27.478
is this data that you see here.
So you can see, I've just gone

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-5
00:14:27.478 --> 00:14:30.972
from overview to sales. So
naturally when I go into the

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-6
00:14:30.972 --> 00:14:34.716
sales slice, the columns will be
more aligned to the slices

0d1fff38-9927-4499-a4ab-9af1a84fa13a-7
00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:38.460
they're looking at, which is why
you see sales information.

9e0c5cde-27cd-4d0b-9718-a4a10e9009f7-0
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.287
The data is not here because
we're still populating all of

9e0c5cde-27cd-4d0b-9718-a4a10e9009f7-1
00:14:41.287 --> 00:14:44.111
that data, but you could see,
for example, there's a lot of

9e0c5cde-27cd-4d0b-9718-a4a10e9009f7-2
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:45.100
space in these cells.

d71227a5-8a95-4228-89c7-74d663ca347e-0
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.074
Does the width of these sales
cells affect you in any way or

d71227a5-8a95-4228-89c7-74d663ca347e-1
00:14:49.074 --> 00:14:52.583
do you have any feedback on sort
of the view that you're seeing

d71227a5-8a95-4228-89c7-74d663ca347e-2
00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:55.764
at the minute? I mean, to me
it's just empty space if you

d71227a5-8a95-4228-89c7-74d663ca347e-3
00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:57.079
were able to tighten it.

740dd8a7-a998-446a-b071-81015cf9ed16-0
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.280
And you might get, you know, you
might be able to get another

740dd8a7-a998-446a-b071-81015cf9ed16-1
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.869
year to show without having to
scroll. I'm not one. I hate

740dd8a7-a998-446a-b071-81015cf9ed16-2
00:15:05.869 --> 00:15:09.640
scroll. I'm terrible. I'm lazy.
I hate scrolling. So if I can

740dd8a7-a998-446a-b071-81015cf9ed16-3
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.229
see what I need to see in one
view, I mean, you don't ever

740dd8a7-a998-446a-b071-81015cf9ed16-4
00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:16.999
have. I mean, if you know the
most you're going to have is 6.

d266a8c5-9894-4743-875a-95733fd56243-0
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.100
Characters across.

095d5633-79c2-46d5-9ac7-9ec5a929e989-0
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.270
Yeah.

1d8dbe5e-d1e4-4c26-ae7a-26352cf144cf-0
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.360
You can tighten those. I think
if you did that, maybe it would.

716ae5e7-1919-4dee-a694-a2ec64e4cf79-0
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.360
Allow another year to show. I
don't know if that would give

716ae5e7-1919-4dee-a694-a2ec64e4cf79-1
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.580
you enough to show 2027.

0361c85e-09d0-4dbc-93cf-d2aaa83f2cff-0
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.882
OK, interesting. So yeah, I
guess what you're saying is if

0361c85e-09d0-4dbc-93cf-d2aaa83f2cff-1
00:15:34.882 --> 00:15:38.085
there's space there, reduce it
so you could fit more in. If you

0361c85e-09d0-4dbc-93cf-d2aaa83f2cff-2
00:15:38.085 --> 00:15:41.138
can, I mean, otherwise, you
know, I don't, it doesn't bother

0361c85e-09d0-4dbc-93cf-d2aaa83f2cff-3
00:15:41.138 --> 00:15:42.490
me one way or the other. I.

9c20e892-8534-4829-bd0d-dbea9a9aef52-0
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.258
Most times I'm gonna dump this
in Excel anyway and I'm gonna do

9c20e892-8534-4829-bd0d-dbea9a9aef52-1
00:15:48.258 --> 00:15:50.900
my editing there, so OK, fine,
so um.

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-0
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.654
Yeah, that makes sense. Or if
it's expandable, I know I like,

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-1
00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:57.988
I don't know how technically
that's possible, but for the

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-2
00:15:57.988 --> 00:16:01.552
technology or the product name,
if the product name is really

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-3
00:16:01.552 --> 00:16:04.714
long, the column would expand to
accommodate that like

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-4
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:08.105
automatically, you know what I
mean? Yeah, possible, but I

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-5
00:16:08.105 --> 00:16:11.842
throw that out there anyway as a
suggestion. I know exactly what

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-6
00:16:11.842 --> 00:16:15.348
you mean because we have that
functionality. I'm just trying

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-7
00:16:15.348 --> 00:16:19.085
to find something which has got
a lot of text in there if you go

80aa0520-9462-4074-8e17-d966805c8883-8
00:16:19.085 --> 00:16:21.269
into company and you go into
company.

d853b7f9-ceba-4394-b26f-9ba883c45604-0
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.150
Company.

322cd0c5-c10f-417d-8580-76f5ed4483bf-0
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.133
Ohh, here we go. There we go.
Can you see that? This cell?

322cd0c5-c10f-417d-8580-76f5ed4483bf-1
00:16:29.133 --> 00:16:29.380
Yeah.

20dc7f19-1fc1-45ec-9a5e-6bbd11b63ce0-0
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.830
Let me just zoom in a little bit
so.

47770313-ca6f-409d-a3b4-d0b9b41aeb4d-0
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.793
Um, yeah, Diana. So you can see,
for example, on this one or not,

47770313-ca6f-409d-a3b4-d0b9b41aeb4d-1
00:16:36.793 --> 00:16:39.422
all of the information fits in
that cell. So when you

47770313-ca6f-409d-a3b4-d0b9b41aeb4d-2
00:16:39.422 --> 00:16:42.343
naturally, if you hover over any
other cells, it doesn't do

47770313-ca6f-409d-a3b4-d0b9b41aeb4d-3
00:16:42.343 --> 00:16:45.410
anything. If anything's got more
information in there, it goes

47770313-ca6f-409d-a3b4-d0b9b41aeb4d-4
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.039
blue and you see this expand
icon. Yeah, that's good.

f4263072-3b92-4ccb-9fd2-3abad6ea94a3-0
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.280
Cool.

5e3abfea-8992-46a1-b891-550a40440e34-0
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.369
See. I guess, yeah, that's what
you're referring to, um. OK,

5e3abfea-8992-46a1-b891-550a40440e34-1
00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:58.759
perfect. That's really helpful.
So the last thing I wanted to

5e3abfea-8992-46a1-b891-550a40440e34-2
00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:01.380
show you is our drug item pages,
so.

d7dc0ba7-9da1-473c-841e-a1ee35f5f23a-0
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.610
If I was to click on.

95028701-cfca-474b-b37c-1088806202f9-0
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.970
Apixaban, if I'm pronouncing
that correctly.

18723280-7df2-49f9-9aa3-c6937d0f1157-0
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.474
Um, this will take you into your
specific drug item page that

18723280-7df2-49f9-9aa3-c6937d0f1157-1
00:17:12.474 --> 00:17:16.119
before what we saw is an
overview of all drugs. This

18723280-7df2-49f9-9aa3-c6937d0f1157-2
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.319
would be just for this drug, so.

2e2776d8-faa5-4310-9612-fdb3523fba45-0
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.440
Again, you've got some.

7baea114-d60f-49f1-8a4b-70cef9e37ae3-0
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.883
High level information above in
terms of you know, the branded

7baea114-d60f-49f1-8a4b-70cef9e37ae3-1
00:17:24.883 --> 00:17:28.180
name, the status indication,
etc. Some KPIs that will be

7baea114-d60f-49f1-8a4b-70cef9e37ae3-2
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.610
related just to that drug, not
all drugs.

f3bc86d8-ac7e-4207-8757-6f23490f4d8d-0
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.854
Um, and then obviously your
curated data views as well. Um.

f3bc86d8-ac7e-4207-8757-6f23490f4d8d-1
00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:38.485
And your updated data columns to
sort of too much what you're

f3bc86d8-ac7e-4207-8757-6f23490f4d8d-2
00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:39.130
looking at?

f4967e63-b6bd-45dc-a070-aabaa54fbff6-0
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.720
Do you have any any feedback on
this?

f0f63a24-bcb7-4048-b0b2-dce6266104cc-0
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.156
Yeah, I think it looks good. And
if you put the ability to filter

f0f63a24-bcb7-4048-b0b2-dce6266104cc-1
00:17:47.156 --> 00:17:47.560
on here.

8d1adc28-4abe-46e1-9f55-167f1687bb84-0
00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.358
So in other words, you're
showing five years worth of

8d1adc28-4abe-46e1-9f55-167f1687bb84-1
00:17:52.358 --> 00:17:56.231
sales, right, 22 and 2026 if I
want to go back or I want to add

8d1adc28-4abe-46e1-9f55-167f1687bb84-2
00:17:56.231 --> 00:17:57.260
out through 2028?

11cee5e6-05df-4094-8ac9-52c7c94197f9-0
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.200
Will we be able to filter?

840a11c7-8286-4adb-a1ee-7a28af12dbbc-0
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.810
Or no.

763e44e4-0eb0-47ef-b1ae-6c74e444e6fd-0
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:06.920
Yes.

114bf373-f6f2-49d6-b10e-5599c75c6992-0
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.420
OK.

8f66f1c7-467a-41a8-b652-365eb2e1d1b7-0
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.780
So we're building the ability
for.

ade098c8-b357-4ab1-93c4-6f0669633abc-0
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.510
Filters to be applied at on the
table.

b4becd0d-8774-4945-97a9-1ae4ca8074f0-0
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.610
And then those of you reflected
in the.

09dd07c0-4ccd-4834-99cb-12e82121b052-0
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.330
Metrics at the top.

bfbe912e-8196-456d-b1c1-ba7c32ab6e36-0
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.300
OK.

1ca738b8-f3cd-49e5-b788-84182662d11b-0
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.410
Good. So yeah, filter this and
sort the topic updates

1ca738b8-f3cd-49e5-b788-84182662d11b-1
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.331
accordingly. Um, OK, cool. So I
think we have quite a, I think

1ca738b8-f3cd-49e5-b788-84182662d11b-2
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:36.879
we've still got another 1520
minutes. That's pretty much

1ca738b8-f3cd-49e5-b788-84182662d11b-3
00:18:36.879 --> 00:18:40.862
everything I wanted to show you.
It's a little bit quicker just

1ca738b8-f3cd-49e5-b788-84182662d11b-4
00:18:40.862 --> 00:18:41.360
because.

6fcfd827-16d7-4540-8b29-fb84e83f95a7-0
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.651
We, we, we've obviously we've
done this before, so I was only

6fcfd827-16d7-4540-8b29-fb84e83f95a7-1
00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:48.516
kind of showing you the
additional bits. The only other

6fcfd827-16d7-4540-8b29-fb84e83f95a7-2
00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:50.000
thing I wanted to mention is.

3ba89596-f580-43f5-ae8f-665d50cbdbed-0
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.642
Do you at all use any other
service providers like data

3ba89596-f580-43f5-ae8f-665d50cbdbed-1
00:18:54.642 --> 00:18:59.043
service providers on a mobile
phone, or would you see the need

3ba89596-f580-43f5-ae8f-665d50cbdbed-2
00:18:59.043 --> 00:19:03.444
of it? At the moment evaluate is
only sort of best suited to a

3ba89596-f580-43f5-ae8f-665d50cbdbed-3
00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:05.679
laptop or a desktop screen size.

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-0
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.324
Potentially doing a bit of
research in terms of, you know,

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-1
00:19:10.324 --> 00:19:13.413
is a mobile app solution
something that our customers

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-2
00:19:13.413 --> 00:19:17.131
want us. So I thought as part of
this testing and we're speaking

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-3
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:20.620
to loads of customers, let's
just get our customers thoughts

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-4
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.995
on it. So do you have any
thoughts on that? That's kind of

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-5
00:19:23.995 --> 00:19:27.541
interesting. So I don't have
like an iPad or a tablet. I know

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-6
00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:30.858
other people on the team do
always tether to my computer,

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-7
00:19:30.858 --> 00:19:34.176
but I will say that there's
times when I do get questions

b4b0ef3a-86dc-46b6-8067-0177e6d2f5d6-8
00:19:34.176 --> 00:19:34.920
that come up.

419f5c3b-a98d-424c-a60b-722480d9d785-0
00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.301
On a like a non business hours
or on a weekend and I'm not

419f5c3b-a98d-424c-a60b-722480d9d785-1
00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:44.785
home, you know it happened
Saturday. My VP sent me a text

419f5c3b-a98d-424c-a60b-722480d9d785-2
00:19:44.785 --> 00:19:47.260
and she wanted some information.

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-0
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.719
And I was like, well, I can grab
some stuff right off of our

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-1
00:19:52.719 --> 00:19:56.024
signal, you know, our internal
CI site signal that I can use on

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-2
00:19:56.024 --> 00:19:59.225
my mobile, on my phone. And I
was able to pull some stuff and

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-3
00:19:59.225 --> 00:20:02.374
send her. Obviously, I didn't
download documents. I sent her

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-4
00:20:02.374 --> 00:20:05.369
links to the pages where those
documents were. One of the

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-5
00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:08.519
things she wanted to look at was
sales and forecast for that

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-6
00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:11.668
market. And I said, are you
going to have to wait till I get

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-7
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:14.714
home? Because there's some of
that embedded in some of the

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-8
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.864
syndicated reports that I'm
pulling for you. I said, but I'm

b65e9d9d-2025-485a-b0b4-1da2823bdefd-9
00:20:17.864 --> 00:20:19.619
not home and I can't get into
it.

01626bca-ee6f-4ca8-a1e7-6d9079a7c0a3-0
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.562
Not going to go into evaluate
pharma on my phone because I

01626bca-ee6f-4ca8-a1e7-6d9079a7c0a3-1
00:20:21.562 --> 00:20:22.420
wouldn't have been able to.

444b6f46-7340-44d8-80fa-5006a2dca352-0
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.887
Would have been useless. So in
those cases it's not a bad idea

444b6f46-7340-44d8-80fa-5006a2dca352-1
00:20:26.887 --> 00:20:27.990
and I'll tell you.

4badec4a-0c26-4cd3-a6a9-a38c71574f3c-0
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.935
I struggle the same thing with
our, with our signal site

4badec4a-0c26-4cd3-a6a9-a38c71574f3c-1
00:20:31.935 --> 00:20:35.355
because people, you know, I've
had people say to me, well, you

4badec4a-0c26-4cd3-a6a9-a38c71574f3c-2
00:20:35.355 --> 00:20:38.342
know, executives and stuff
already. Senior leaders are

4badec4a-0c26-4cd3-a6a9-a38c71574f3c-3
00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:41.546
running in and out of meetings.
You know, everybody's on a

4badec4a-0c26-4cd3-a6a9-a38c71574f3c-4
00:20:41.546 --> 00:20:44.912
phone. Nobody's like, you know,
not always on their laptop or

4badec4a-0c26-4cd3-a6a9-a38c71574f3c-5
00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:45.890
they have an iPad.

906c7048-62f9-4ddc-8b82-12d034801989-0
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.966
So when we did the last redesign
of our portal, we they actually

906c7048-62f9-4ddc-8b82-12d034801989-1
00:20:51.966 --> 00:20:57.090
the vendor used Google material
design and what happens is the

906c7048-62f9-4ddc-8b82-12d034801989-2
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:02.459
the view renders to fit whatever
it is device it is you're using.

906c7048-62f9-4ddc-8b82-12d034801989-3
00:21:02.459 --> 00:21:07.257
So when I use signal on my
iPhone I there's more menus and

906c7048-62f9-4ddc-8b82-12d034801989-4
00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:12.381
drop downs that I have to click
on in order to navigate. But I

906c7048-62f9-4ddc-8b82-12d034801989-5
00:21:12.381 --> 00:21:15.310
have the option and I never I
mean.

3f1408f0-feba-4a09-b745-c5ad6b51dc5e-0
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.791
I can't even believe people
watch movies on these things.

3f1408f0-feba-4a09-b745-c5ad6b51dc5e-1
00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:23.164
Like, you know, they're so
small. But in that case, when

3f1408f0-feba-4a09-b745-c5ad6b51dc5e-2
00:21:23.164 --> 00:21:26.595
you're cut short or you're it's
an emergency, you're in a

3f1408f0-feba-4a09-b745-c5ad6b51dc5e-3
00:21:26.595 --> 00:21:29.850
meeting, you can't get back to
your laptop. It's nice.

ed820155-ae3e-4f17-aed5-f61caadbd30c-0
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.018
Having the option to be able to
do it, I can't imagine how you

ed820155-ae3e-4f17-aed5-f61caadbd30c-1
00:21:35.018 --> 00:21:35.780
guys would.

13e4fdbe-d152-4eab-94c4-12ce77641178-0
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.681
They are, you know, a tablet,
iPad or whatever kind of tablets

13e4fdbe-d152-4eab-94c4-12ce77641178-1
00:21:40.681 --> 00:21:44.648
there are would make a little
bit more sense. I can't imagine

13e4fdbe-d152-4eab-94c4-12ce77641178-2
00:21:44.648 --> 00:21:48.552
being able to search, evaluate
pharma on my phone and scroll

13e4fdbe-d152-4eab-94c4-12ce77641178-3
00:21:48.552 --> 00:21:50.280
and look through, you know?

9232548a-17ea-4bd9-9b22-17565d10e96d-0
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.980
I don't know now if I needed a
quick number. OK, so I don't

9232548a-17ea-4bd9-9b22-17565d10e96d-1
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.868
know for multiple myeloma,
what's the size of the market

9232548a-17ea-4bd9-9b22-17565d10e96d-2
00:21:56.868 --> 00:21:59.959
today? What's it going to look
like in 2028? That's two data

9232548a-17ea-4bd9-9b22-17565d10e96d-3
00:21:59.959 --> 00:22:03.049
points. I can look. I can jot
down a number and e-mail those

9232548a-17ea-4bd9-9b22-17565d10e96d-4
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:04.569
numbers or text those numbers.

d402947a-d776-4e8d-9882-822e85c14b36-0
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.747
I wouldn't. I don't see myself
spending hours and hours using

d402947a-d776-4e8d-9882-822e85c14b36-1
00:22:08.747 --> 00:22:10.300
evaluate pharma on a mobile.

c350b51d-da2b-42af-84d6-0058abae2bc3-0
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.020
But if.

6b74ee21-635a-4021-8af2-0e05e539e77a-0
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.255
You had the ability to give up
to do that. There might be some

6b74ee21-635a-4021-8af2-0e05e539e77a-1
00:22:16.255 --> 00:22:19.660
people who would take advantage
of that. For me, it would when

6b74ee21-635a-4021-8af2-0e05e539e77a-2
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.174
I'm not home or I'm not in front
of my laptop and somebody needs

6b74ee21-635a-4021-8af2-0e05e539e77a-3
00:22:23.174 --> 00:22:24.850
a quick answer, a quick number.

5521959f-ef6a-4bfc-9be5-a2186de330f4-0
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.044
I go to other places for that
now because I can get to other

5521959f-ef6a-4bfc-9be5-a2186de330f4-1
00:22:30.044 --> 00:22:31.900
places easier on my phone.

9dec6017-4d51-4da3-b403-dc9ec8086cfe-0
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:33.600
But.

6f29a802-dbe7-4c00-ae1a-910250f5fc07-0
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.169
I wouldn't be running reports,
building reports off of my

6f29a802-dbe7-4c00-ae1a-910250f5fc07-1
00:22:38.169 --> 00:22:41.540
phone. I mean, I there's no way
I would want to do that.

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-0
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.008
Sure. So in terms of if we did
have a mobile app or a mobile

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-1
00:22:46.008 --> 00:22:49.848
friendly version of the website,
um, available then what would

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-2
00:22:49.848 --> 00:22:53.871
you expect to run from there. So
I mean I guess there's you won't

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-3
00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:57.467
be creating reports and stuff
like that. But in terms of I

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-4
00:22:57.467 --> 00:23:01.369
would do it to just get you know
somebody said to me what's the

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-5
00:23:01.369 --> 00:23:04.660
size of the worldwide
pharmaceutical market I want, I

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-6
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.257
would want the ability to run
one of my, you know, a saved

086e23ab-a4e3-413a-8fb3-1d4c1857710e-7
00:23:08.257 --> 00:23:11.000
report so that I can get the
answer to that.

362aa050-21c1-4d95-a361-4165c56c94de-0
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.647
But it would be for quick
lookups some you know phase of

362aa050-21c1-4d95-a361-4165c56c94de-1
00:23:15.647 --> 00:23:19.270
development that's something in
or whatever. That's what I would

362aa050-21c1-4d95-a361-4165c56c94de-2
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.838
use it for. I would not the kind
of work that I do and evaluate

362aa050-21c1-4d95-a361-4165c56c94de-3
00:23:22.838 --> 00:23:26.127
farmer when I'm in there and
working. I would not be doing

362aa050-21c1-4d95-a361-4165c56c94de-4
00:23:26.127 --> 00:23:29.193
that makes sense. So yeah
specifically specify my eyes

362aa050-21c1-4d95-a361-4165c56c94de-5
00:23:29.193 --> 00:23:32.649
would like glaze over you know
these screens are just not big

362aa050-21c1-4d95-a361-4165c56c94de-6
00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:33.040
enough.

0d97bbb8-1dc5-40e5-9d93-631e355dd86d-0
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.169
And if you're asking me a
question and I'm like, well, I'm

0d97bbb8-1dc5-40e5-9d93-631e355dd86d-1
00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:40.163
in a meeting, I'm off site at a
meeting. I won't get, you know,

0d97bbb8-1dc5-40e5-9d93-631e355dd86d-2
00:23:40.163 --> 00:23:43.251
back in back into the office for
another 2 hours. I can certainly

0d97bbb8-1dc5-40e5-9d93-631e355dd86d-3
00:23:43.251 --> 00:23:44.140
get a quick answer.

186439eb-5f20-4797-9296-7cb5fd471e54-0
00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.616
Cool. That's really helpful to
know. Nick, I think you had a

186439eb-5f20-4797-9296-7cb5fd471e54-1
00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:50.400
question, um.

440b98b5-d7a0-4323-b3e2-c46888e9fa51-0
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.851
I I note that some ankle with
we've come to the end of the

440b98b5-d7a0-4323-b3e2-c46888e9fa51-1
00:23:53.851 --> 00:23:56.813
sort of um the tour um and we're
sort of asking some additional

440b98b5-d7a0-4323-b3e2-c46888e9fa51-2
00:23:56.813 --> 00:23:59.683
questions. Would you mind if I
ask some questions? Of course,

440b98b5-d7a0-4323-b3e2-c46888e9fa51-3
00:23:59.683 --> 00:24:00.979
yeah. Would you mind, Diana?

ae6cb24e-0901-466a-8430-ab2e471c4e04-0
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.798
Great. I'm gonna share my screen
if that's OK. Go ahead. Right.

ae6cb24e-0901-466a-8430-ab2e471c4e04-1
00:24:06.798 --> 00:24:07.020
OK.

21374208-b426-45e7-9714-e0e7beaf8c40-0
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.110
So, um, you mentioned that your.

2c26a320-e4e5-44f9-bf8b-35ce21a10b2a-0
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.620
You can see that, Yep, the
you're a use case that you use.

b96cc056-61f2-40b1-9225-9855b260eac7-0
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.428
That you go through very, very
often is um, kind of a global

b96cc056-61f2-40b1-9225-9855b260eac7-1
00:24:21.428 --> 00:24:24.024
market site. What's the
worldwide market or what's the

b96cc056-61f2-40b1-9225-9855b260eac7-2
00:24:24.024 --> 00:24:25.110
company ranking, right?

abd09402-1e8f-4f3b-8b6b-f66a65a8dff2-0
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.290
Yep. Um, so in the current um
system.

06abd4d6-2c21-4ddf-80d9-5ddaad5b45e9-0
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.710
Uh.

4ab7e938-dbf9-43f0-a669-853d4b3346b8-0
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.104
So my question, so, so what's
the is, is the worldwide market

4ab7e938-dbf9-43f0-a669-853d4b3346b8-1
00:24:37.104 --> 00:24:41.143
for a given indication something
like that, is that correct? It's

4ab7e938-dbf9-43f0-a669-853d4b3346b8-2
00:24:41.143 --> 00:24:45.060
for the branded pharma market,
so market you guys created and I

4ab7e938-dbf9-43f0-a669-853d4b3346b8-3
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.732
forget who created it for me
couple years ago. So I just go

4ab7e938-dbf9-43f0-a669-853d4b3346b8-4
00:24:48.732 --> 00:24:52.526
to the RX branded market report
and I click on that and I run

4ab7e938-dbf9-43f0-a669-853d4b3346b8-5
00:24:52.526 --> 00:24:52.710
it.

fe5b845a-4b18-4d89-a63b-fe2623448ba2-0
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.341
And then Anastasia created one
because now they don't want

fe5b845a-4b18-4d89-a63b-fe2623448ba2-1
00:24:56.341 --> 00:24:59.363
COVID in the in the market. So I
have two worldwide markets

fe5b845a-4b18-4d89-a63b-fe2623448ba2-2
00:24:59.363 --> 00:25:02.334
depending upon what I'm running
it for, but it's the total

fe5b845a-4b18-4d89-a63b-fe2623448ba2-3
00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:03.090
branded market.

048f90e7-16c2-43e7-b32b-e7f92806a1d9-0
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.207
Total branded market, OK. We
take out generics and we take

048f90e7-16c2-43e7-b32b-e7f92806a1d9-1
00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:11.720
out any OTC that might be in
here. Understood. Got it.

50791bac-e0e0-4a2a-8ba0-e52f5a6e2770-0
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.280
OK.

aa4236e0-6a85-4390-9d9c-fe7c276fd9aa-0
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.908
OK, and if you go in my folder,
you'll see the reports. If you

aa4236e0-6a85-4390-9d9c-fe7c276fd9aa-1
00:25:19.908 --> 00:25:22.400
wanna look at it, go ahead and
poke around.

2233f997-5aa8-4f1d-a516-de6a47e9d088-0
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.327
Got it. OK. I I think I can
imagine kind of what that looks

2233f997-5aa8-4f1d-a516-de6a47e9d088-1
00:25:27.327 --> 00:25:31.230
like. Um. But uh, yeah. May also
go and have a look. Um.

f4941119-254c-418c-975e-0a4c981339d5-0
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.060
OK, so.

b04fb20a-9ccc-4c7c-9e31-5a9700ac6497-0
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.900
In terms of these metrics?

41f466ed-517c-4672-81b6-b31871fe7eea-0
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.496
I think, I think you said top
therapeutic categories is

41f466ed-517c-4672-81b6-b31871fe7eea-1
00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:42.190
something which.

7787c29f-2662-4283-9f45-18307e6b1d4a-0
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.270
It would be useful, right?
Because.

a7aba597-4a18-4eb4-963b-b985f49b7fd8-0
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.690
Um, you you've mentioned that a
couple, I think you mentioned

a7aba597-4a18-4eb4-963b-b985f49b7fd8-1
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.130
that one, you called that one
out.

0690eb6d-b21c-42ff-8730-423ba35ce041-0
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.580
And these are the ones
interesting.

e72d241c-57c4-433a-ad12-7c2b37f1ca15-0
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:58.008
Top mean the tab indications.
Yeah, because, you know, I was

e72d241c-57c4-433a-ad12-7c2b37f1ca15-1
00:25:58.008 --> 00:26:01.920
recently working on something
where I was asked like.

509ab8cb-4103-4d14-9e89-e86a501c87d8-0
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:07.624
You know around targets and you
know areas that companies are

509ab8cb-4103-4d14-9e89-e86a501c87d8-1
00:26:07.624 --> 00:26:12.801
focusing in. So you know MOA is
useful and and top indications,

509ab8cb-4103-4d14-9e89-e86a501c87d8-2
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:18.058
but I see I would want to drill
right, so you've got solid tumor

509ab8cb-4103-4d14-9e89-e86a501c87d8-3
00:26:18.058 --> 00:26:21.860
indications I would want to see
OK, so out of.

875fffce-644b-4394-b54d-db81a2b9f879-0
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.996
The solid tumor, like what are
the ones that are at the top of

875fffce-644b-4394-b54d-db81a2b9f879-1
00:26:26.996 --> 00:26:28.070
the list, right?

3ded3637-7dc6-4938-81f5-8c85027c6c1d-0
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.439
So that's why I asked you about
filtering or being able to drill

3ded3637-7dc6-4938-81f5-8c85027c6c1d-1
00:26:33.439 --> 00:26:37.850
down this very quickly tells me
no surprise it's it's all, it's

3ded3637-7dc6-4938-81f5-8c85027c6c1d-2
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.398
all about oncology, but it's OK.
So for solid tumors is a breast,

3ded3637-7dc6-4938-81f5-8c85027c6c1d-3
00:26:42.398 --> 00:26:46.740
is it lung, is it you know what
is it, I'd want to go further.

ef64edb4-cc42-4361-8243-281017b1e1c6-0
00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:47.790
Yeah.

7cf5046a-909e-4f03-bf1f-944187cf6cc1-0
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.610
My slow sense.

50d4159f-fe93-4e69-9971-aada421f890f-0
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.380
We're going to be building some
charting functionality.

600be2ec-4146-4cb9-bffc-f7f512ff51d0-0
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.780
For this page.

d6c5906f-bf6f-40ab-9c6d-6d4e25d2e6ba-0
00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:58.930
We're proposing.

f3ce7098-a758-492a-99ce-8f77c003eb6d-0
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.940
That the chart would show.

bde2b774-5143-40b9-895b-d827bd8c6306-0
00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:04.760
They essentially be a bar chart
that would show.

d3951aae-86b1-486e-94d7-3da32ba4f38b-0
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.540
Sales by year.

6f3e4461-1b42-4f59-baa9-44b49dabdc47-0
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.070
Actual and projected.

59304ed6-42bf-4492-b71a-2cf8e617867d-0
00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.030
Can you think of any other
visualizations that you?

68b114ef-4bdc-445d-8fc7-320773b4b130-0
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.000
Funny.

1897b05b-e077-4e28-aaf0-4b9730034079-0
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.695
The well, let me ask you this,
you're going to put a, you know,

1897b05b-e077-4e28-aaf0-4b9730034079-1
00:27:20.695 --> 00:27:24.881
create some visuals which I
think would make this page even

1897b05b-e077-4e28-aaf0-4b9730034079-2
00:27:24.881 --> 00:27:25.300
nicer.

9a9f4996-d92e-4a49-a554-c3330138cacc-0
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.418
Would you give people the
ability to change the visual? So

9a9f4996-d92e-4a49-a554-c3330138cacc-1
00:27:29.418 --> 00:27:32.387
have options? So there's a bar
chart. Maybe we want a line

9a9f4996-d92e-4a49-a554-c3330138cacc-2
00:27:32.387 --> 00:27:35.305
chart, maybe we want a bubble
chart. People here like the

9a9f4996-d92e-4a49-a554-c3330138cacc-3
00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:35.960
bubble chart.

ed49b519-ad1a-4a68-bcc4-843bb421721c-0
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:36.960
Hmm.

1a56abf7-1485-4b2b-b187-87299a91dbbf-0
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.270
Where the bubble would represent
the size of whatever, whether

1a56abf7-1485-4b2b-b187-87299a91dbbf-1
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.719
it's number of indications and
development or sales or

1a56abf7-1485-4b2b-b187-87299a91dbbf-2
00:27:45.719 --> 00:27:49.356
whatever. The bubble would
represent the that number, the

1a56abf7-1485-4b2b-b187-87299a91dbbf-3
00:27:49.356 --> 00:27:49.670
size.

044a4452-4b94-4998-a11a-0401acaa32aa-0
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.210
Gotcha.

99561f07-9c15-418c-9da3-7d0c75f1c623-0
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.119
Literally had to recreate the
bubble chart that you put your

99561f07-9c15-418c-9da3-7d0c75f1c623-1
00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:00.558
world Farmer reports because
that's what they wanted to see.

99561f07-9c15-418c-9da3-7d0c75f1c623-2
00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:03.997
But then when I update that
report a couple times a year, we

99561f07-9c15-418c-9da3-7d0c75f1c623-3
00:28:03.997 --> 00:28:07.492
know your forecast get updated.
So running the data behind it

99561f07-9c15-418c-9da3-7d0c75f1c623-4
00:28:07.492 --> 00:28:11.100
and having it sit made it a lot
easier for me because otherwise

99561f07-9c15-418c-9da3-7d0c75f1c623-5
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.314
I'm taking a screenshot and I
know we've talked on other

99561f07-9c15-418c-9da3-7d0c75f1c623-6
00:28:14.314 --> 00:28:16.399
calls, so if you're going to
create.

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-0
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.647
Even if it's a bar chart, I'm
gonna go back to something I've

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-1
00:28:20.647 --> 00:28:24.446
said on a number of these calls.
I want the ability to export the

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-2
00:28:24.446 --> 00:28:27.783
bar chart. I don't want to have
to recreate the bar chart

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-3
00:28:27.783 --> 00:28:31.351
because if I want to put it in
signal, I'd love for people to

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-4
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:34.862
be able to mouse over the bar
and see the number. Now I know

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-5
00:28:34.862 --> 00:28:38.084
that people can't then click
through to get to evaluate

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-6
00:28:38.084 --> 00:28:41.767
pharma unless they have a seat.
But all of the visuals that I'm

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-7
00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:44.933
putting on my company
dashboards, and I'm getting most

63d212bb-05bf-45fd-ac8f-7382148dca0b-8
00:28:44.933 --> 00:28:47.350
of it from evaluate pharma, I'm
manually.

ea52e654-cd50-496e-8678-a94ee1c707c7-0
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.877
Creating you know how many hours
of time and hours of work that

ea52e654-cd50-496e-8678-a94ee1c707c7-1
00:28:50.877 --> 00:28:51.040
is.

2d97df4e-6aae-48a9-843b-ad3af3a3b76a-0
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.040
And I'm actually looking for an
alternative source where I can.

0f8aa027-6844-40c9-951d-518e740af489-0
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.168
Get the visuals onto the
dashboard and have them updated

0f8aa027-6844-40c9-951d-518e740af489-1
00:29:00.168 --> 00:29:03.433
as you update the numbers
because I I've got 50 something

0f8aa027-6844-40c9-951d-518e740af489-2
00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:06.530
company dashboards I can't. It's
just not sustainable.

1bc74029-40d9-4bae-b750-f185d8c3c090-0
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.688
I mean I can show you what it
looks like quick if you want to

1bc74029-40d9-4bae-b750-f185d8c3c090-1
00:29:11.688 --> 00:29:15.466
remind our refresh of what it
looks like, but this would this

1bc74029-40d9-4bae-b750-f185d8c3c090-2
00:29:15.466 --> 00:29:19.062
page would be great if you had
visuals and then I want the

1bc74029-40d9-4bae-b750-f185d8c3c090-3
00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:19.550
ability.

9ce61ef2-a186-4022-a264-c9831bb0391c-0
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.489
I know I asked for a lot, but
look, if you don't ask, what's

9ce61ef2-a186-4022-a264-c9831bb0391c-1
00:29:23.489 --> 00:29:26.474
the worst? She tell me like no,
you you're like crazy. I can't

9ce61ef2-a186-4022-a264-c9831bb0391c-2
00:29:26.474 --> 00:29:28.180
do it. Can you see my dad? You
see.

2bc72ae6-1ea2-4ad9-8a89-76bf533a35a2-0
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.720
Go ahead again. Sorry, sorry if
you don't mind.

17a7f0c9-647c-4565-8369-724c5f15711c-0
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.470
You can see my screen, right?
Yes.

1789f411-92af-4f9d-a4f3-738126f5f5d8-0
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.930
Alright, let me go to a company
dashboard.

7637792b-a35e-4a5d-9d27-8cdbef88eb82-0
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:49.740
OK.

00d9beff-8995-4971-a750-a278f20435cd-0
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:56.317
2026 worldwide sales by TA, Top
product sales, R&amp;D projects

00d9beff-8995-4971-a750-a278f20435cd-1
00:29:56.317 --> 00:30:00.494
by therapy or this is all coming
from evaluate pharma. The last

00d9beff-8995-4971-a750-a278f20435cd-2
00:30:00.494 --> 00:30:04.410
time I we updated these 50
something company dashboards was

00d9beff-8995-4971-a750-a278f20435cd-3
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.520
back in November.

c561d6e9-c0ad-4e52-8eb2-22106a7088f1-0
00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:11.702
Because this is all I go in, I
go to the Abbey company page in

c561d6e9-c0ad-4e52-8eb2-22106a7088f1-1
00:30:11.702 --> 00:30:16.673
evaluate pharma, I export and
then when I get this into Excel

c561d6e9-c0ad-4e52-8eb2-22106a7088f1-2
00:30:16.673 --> 00:30:21.806
I actually have to play around
with it a little bit in order to

c561d6e9-c0ad-4e52-8eb2-22106a7088f1-3
00:30:21.806 --> 00:30:26.697
create this view. Now if you
created if I had the ability to

c561d6e9-c0ad-4e52-8eb2-22106a7088f1-4
00:30:26.697 --> 00:30:27.660
export this.

72783293-e75a-45f5-bfa1-112d3b340efd-0
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.477
In an iframe with an iframe code
because that's what I need. Then

72783293-e75a-45f5-bfa1-112d3b340efd-1
00:30:32.477 --> 00:30:36.324
it goes into this dashboard and
what I call interactive mode so

72783293-e75a-45f5-bfa1-112d3b340efd-2
00:30:36.324 --> 00:30:39.450
as people mouse over the bars
they see the numbers.

8e78a0bf-5bcb-4336-bd9a-9fb30f4dc23a-0
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.190
And I wouldn't have to do all
this manual work.

7f62d1a6-add6-4118-b376-994fcac4ce83-0
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.020
Does that make sense? That
doesn't make sense.

f4b3741b-afb2-43b9-94a6-53a633f355f3-0
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:52.972
This that's what I'm looking to
do. So now I'm saying are there

f4b3741b-afb2-43b9-94a6-53a633f355f3-1
00:30:52.972 --> 00:30:55.990
other sources where I can get
this information?

2990f6c9-9166-4dd9-bce0-4aac7167856d-0
00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.157
As much as I want to cite
evaluate pharma, because

2990f6c9-9166-4dd9-bce0-4aac7167856d-1
00:31:01.157 --> 00:31:04.987
evaluate pharma is what I'm
using and I'll show you real

2990f6c9-9166-4dd9-bce0-4aac7167856d-2
00:31:04.987 --> 00:31:09.086
quick the ranking dash the top
10 dashboards that I have and

2990f6c9-9166-4dd9-bce0-4aac7167856d-3
00:31:09.086 --> 00:31:13.051
you'll see the ranking chart
that comes from what I create

2990f6c9-9166-4dd9-bce0-4aac7167856d-4
00:31:13.051 --> 00:31:16.210
from that branded ranking report
that I saved.

dc0fa459-7f55-4b26-81c3-e4c0b5033da3-0
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.237
So I run the report and then I
go into PowerPoint and I

dc0fa459-7f55-4b26-81c3-e4c0b5033da3-1
00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:23.405
manually, you know, I do this
and then this gets updated a

dc0fa459-7f55-4b26-81c3-e4c0b5033da3-2
00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:24.480
couple times a year.

bb195c10-d61a-4cbd-94f7-2c09092cb2a9-0
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.430
So.

401b99b3-9051-4e1d-810c-3b53d4d80093-0
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.150
Being able to export and being
able to get.

d9ea5281-c1fa-495c-896d-377239e541f1-0
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:36.029
The iframe code where I don't
have to do all this manual work

d9ea5281-c1fa-495c-896d-377239e541f1-1
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:40.140
is ultimately what I'm after,
and as much As for the.

8cacd15e-bc7d-4e84-851c-6f475ff30106-0
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.796
Dashboards, for those, you know,
evaluate farmers, our trusted

8cacd15e-bc7d-4e84-851c-6f475ff30106-1
00:31:45.796 --> 00:31:48.968
source of information. I am
looking elsewhere because I just

8cacd15e-bc7d-4e84-851c-6f475ff30106-2
00:31:48.968 --> 00:31:50.840
can't sustain all that manual
work.

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-0
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.625
Because to me, here we are
almost November 2022, some of

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-1
00:31:55.625 --> 00:31:58.916
that information, it's a year,
it's dated, it's a year old. I

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-2
00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:02.313
don't even have year end sales
baked into that, right. So but I

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-3
00:32:02.313 --> 00:32:05.339
just, you know, I have a
contractor that I work with and

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-4
00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:08.258
between her and I, it takes
forever to update them and

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-5
00:32:08.258 --> 00:32:11.390
there's always something more
important. But my concern is

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-6
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.362
over 14,000 people across
J&amp;J are registered signal

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-7
00:32:14.362 --> 00:32:17.388
users. You know how many people
are going to the company

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-8
00:32:17.388 --> 00:32:20.891
dashboards on a regular basis? I
mean I'd have to look and do the

9c7397f7-a941-457b-a928-4a0399d57bf5-9
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:22.589
statistics, do the numbers, but.

d3aad7cf-dc53-4485-b129-b63b489b3fdd-0
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.646
I can tell you those top ten
companies are top ten

d3aad7cf-dc53-4485-b129-b63b489b3fdd-1
00:32:25.646 --> 00:32:27.110
competitors people go to.

08eb16ee-6fef-4b6a-85e7-34b4a150b510-0
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.920
A lot.

b523f85c-d3cd-4593-b1c5-b1b79e4bcbdc-0
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.402
And I want them to have the most
recent information, but you

b523f85c-d3cd-4593-b1c5-b1b79e4bcbdc-1
00:32:33.402 --> 00:32:36.994
know, I'm a person of an end of
1, so it's when I ask those

b523f85c-d3cd-4593-b1c5-b1b79e4bcbdc-2
00:32:36.994 --> 00:32:39.269
types of questions that's where
it's.

cc9d5e69-a575-4256-a7b2-b5f4270017cc-0
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.177
Ultimately where I want to be
able to use it and in order to

cc9d5e69-a575-4256-a7b2-b5f4270017cc-1
00:32:43.177 --> 00:32:43.810
embed stuff.

05175d70-c9e4-4cbc-aae0-b4b412a1f910-0
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.010
Into an into a widget.

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-0
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.797
On a dashboard and make it, you
know, interactive. It's just,

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-1
00:32:50.797 --> 00:32:54.553
and I say because I don't know,
I'm not techie, I say I need a

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-2
00:32:54.553 --> 00:32:58.489
simple iframe code. I don't know
how simple that is or not, but I

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-3
00:32:58.489 --> 00:33:02.067
have it from other tools that
we're using. The other option

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-4
00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:05.883
for me is to dump the data and
give it to my, you know, the put

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-5
00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:08.984
it in the tool that I use to
create visuals because

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-6
00:33:08.984 --> 00:33:12.204
everything within that
visualization tool that I have

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-7
00:33:12.204 --> 00:33:15.901
is embeddable and signal. So
that's just popped into my head.

1ad3b015-c9b9-4e66-9bd0-8bb92d61d987-8
00:33:15.901 --> 00:33:17.690
Maybe that's a way to explore.

4ee824cb-f5ef-4394-a99d-f7996758a010-0
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:22.087
But I still would have to go in
and rerun all the data versus as

4ee824cb-f5ef-4394-a99d-f7996758a010-1
00:33:22.087 --> 00:33:25.952
you're updating your numbers,
then the numbers in that bar

4ee824cb-f5ef-4394-a99d-f7996758a010-2
00:33:25.952 --> 00:33:30.144
chart will automatically update.
That's what I'm after, if that

4ee824cb-f5ef-4394-a99d-f7996758a010-3
00:33:30.144 --> 00:33:30.930
makes sense.

c216cdef-07e6-4d3f-8a4b-e6c9cc435753-0
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.679
That makes a lot of sense. Do
you mind if I ask another quick

c216cdef-07e6-4d3f-8a4b-e6c9cc435753-1
00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:39.001
question? Thank you very much
for that. That was super useful.

c216cdef-07e6-4d3f-8a4b-e6c9cc435753-2
00:33:39.001 --> 00:33:40.320
Um, so quick question #2.

8bb1664a-5160-4b23-bcbc-c650482377a3-0
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.110
This is a drug page where.

5bbdb1e2-03b5-44ff-9796-6fb5f274ee81-0
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.900
Centering this truck page.

2bfe64c7-ade4-486c-b262-7912c0d1cc71-0
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:51.190
On.

608fde77-b0f4-43cb-895f-d9d0478d845f-0
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.160
The generic name.

89e62a58-4c61-40af-9021-0f41df47114a-0
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.136
To the compound and then you
have the products against that

89e62a58-4c61-40af-9021-0f41df47114a-1
00:33:56.136 --> 00:33:56.600
generic name.

4cccd578-78cb-419a-bedf-1c89d74b98ee-0
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:04.109
Ohh sorry this is the I'm sorry.
Yep. So you if you click on for

4cccd578-78cb-419a-bedf-1c89d74b98ee-1
00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:04.700
example.

677e6eac-885d-4f6c-9683-b2c5ab07593b-0
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.740
Ohh.

c331a5b2-8a22-4282-aa58-d6976932c2f4-0
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:10.900
I think I think I've.

2a20979b-baba-45d5-98a0-cf19134b0bb2-0
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.030
One SEC.

82eb5436-36f3-4841-8fab-4686c1ce3990-0
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.959
Um, maybe not such a great
example because it only has

82eb5436-36f3-4841-8fab-4686c1ce3990-1
00:34:40.959 --> 00:34:42.610
three rows, but um.

753c60ef-1a62-4baf-bdcb-0cab1cf3daf3-0
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.640
Where centering.

c1182aed-792c-4f1b-9c8e-086bd1c2e186-0
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.960
These drug item pages on the
generic name.

8f3fc4c5-ca24-4260-8b4b-0d94fbaa4914-0
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.050
So basically if you click on.

b9835f14-49f5-4094-96d9-21fbe7a591b9-0
00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.330
A generic name.

3640b6de-efb2-4acb-a62c-38e0f7327623-0
00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.660
You get.

2572e6cc-51d0-4f45-a584-0b448e586555-0
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.882
A page which is centered on the
compound and then you have

2572e6cc-51d0-4f45-a584-0b448e586555-1
00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:05.080
products against that.

70751194-50ae-479f-a8fc-5b462e0efe9f-0
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.274
How does that sit with you in
terms of how you think about or

70751194-50ae-479f-a8fc-5b462e0efe9f-1
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:13.886
how you use or how you analyze
these these drugs? Do you think

70751194-50ae-479f-a8fc-5b462e0efe9f-2
00:35:13.886 --> 00:35:17.154
about compound 1st and product
second or product 2nd and

70751194-50ae-479f-a8fc-5b462e0efe9f-3
00:35:17.154 --> 00:35:17.670
compound?

e43c667d-3530-48c0-8d9e-fcc58a080d1a-0
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.410
Faster. Um.

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-0
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.548
I mean it depends. So for
example, we know you Meyer is

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-1
00:35:25.548 --> 00:35:29.270
going to go generic, right. So
in cases like that, I mean this

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-2
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:33.169
is fine for me because I want to
see if I'm, if somebody asked me

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-3
00:35:33.169 --> 00:35:36.536
for total sales for that
product, I want to see, I don't

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-4
00:35:36.536 --> 00:35:40.258
care what company it is, I want
to see the total sales. I like

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-5
00:35:40.258 --> 00:35:43.921
that it's broken out because
when I run those reports now you

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-6
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:47.170
know you'll see the compound
name and then you see the

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-7
00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.892
companies that have it and if
there's any sales attributed for

f0354452-a5da-4415-ade3-c0cf8a4e96ef-8
00:35:50.892 --> 00:35:52.310
each of those companies.

7013e931-776d-40df-9822-54d6123cb281-0
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.440
OK, that's interesting. So, so
it actually kind of works for

7013e931-776d-40df-9822-54d6123cb281-1
00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.932
you because you just wanna, you
wanna see the whole picture

7013e931-776d-40df-9822-54d6123cb281-2
00:35:59.932 --> 00:36:03.598
basically. Yes, that makes a lot
of sense. OK, because at that

7013e931-776d-40df-9822-54d6123cb281-3
00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:07.149
time you have right, that's the
combination. So that 13, you

7013e931-776d-40df-9822-54d6123cb281-4
00:36:07.149 --> 00:36:07.440
know.

a4d9856a-d476-4294-a833-0e0af6bc026b-0
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.680
Those numbers, it's, it's total.

ba13e568-08ce-4352-bc97-7e7adccbdf65-0
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:11.820
Yes.

53cf31de-9e8c-4f5b-b205-dbd5a9bd340b-0
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.480
So.

4d965b13-bc7f-4510-a76e-93b7fee6dc56-0
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:15.660
Well, that's it.

907b3758-947b-434f-b5c1-2e7e9eafe401-0
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:22.245
So this is total sales for that
compound for that drug,

907b3758-947b-434f-b5c1-2e7e9eafe401-1
00:36:22.245 --> 00:36:27.533
regardless of what company. But
then this table shows me all the

907b3758-947b-434f-b5c1-2e7e9eafe401-2
00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:29.160
different companies.

a48e17f4-6aa6-409b-a4fe-dd1f1d8173cb-0
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.990
That are working on that or have
you know some kind of

a48e17f4-6aa6-409b-a4fe-dd1f1d8173cb-1
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.950
involvement in it and I can see
where the sales are?

94d56398-90b1-4cba-895d-85f4da57964e-0
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.250
Thank you so this gives you the
best of both.

37d9c5a1-19f7-41d3-b5a1-65feb5b8d581-0
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.960
That makes a lot of sense.

0162445c-00a6-4b41-b0e2-bcce2222a586-0
00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:49.181
That was really, really useful.
Thank you very much. We're just

0162445c-00a6-4b41-b0e2-bcce2222a586-1
00:36:49.181 --> 00:36:52.243
trying to work out if we should
also basically make a page for

0162445c-00a6-4b41-b0e2-bcce2222a586-2
00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:54.820
each individual product as well,
but it sounds like.

d5c05828-7d3c-4d6c-bda9-8a30a814ba62-0
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.303
From your point of view, that
wouldn't be kind of as useful as

d5c05828-7d3c-4d6c-bda9-8a30a814ba62-1
00:36:58.303 --> 00:37:00.820
seeing this like overall view
for the whole generic name.

5edf6fda-44b4-439e-b7cb-2f02a3f5f73e-0
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.610
Yeah, I don't.

f10c9598-5d8f-4259-bd23-e5fba45c576d-0
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.030
Because.

e0ed339a-bf97-49c6-b7e7-24c0858dfd40-0
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.113
If you click on any one of
those, would it take you to the

e0ed339a-bf97-49c6-b7e7-24c0858dfd40-1
00:37:08.113 --> 00:37:11.146
individual for that? Like if you
click on the first one, does it

e0ed339a-bf97-49c6-b7e7-24c0858dfd40-2
00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:13.619
take you to the NPS
Pharmaceuticals record, you know

e0ed339a-bf97-49c6-b7e7-24c0858dfd40-3
00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:14.179
what I mean?

47e74fe8-5138-449f-9414-5bc52896eabb-0
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.499
Hmm. Company. Company. It will
eventually, yes. So. So we are

47e74fe8-5138-449f-9414-5bc52896eabb-1
00:37:18.499 --> 00:37:21.800
building a separate set of
pages. So I don't know. Yeah.

d9609e4f-49f2-4f3c-963f-c03e0424d542-0
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.558
You know, see the the use case
for that. OK, that's really

d9609e4f-49f2-4f3c-963f-c03e0424d542-1
00:37:25.558 --> 00:37:27.930
useful for many other people
may, but not for me.

afa40954-a192-4358-bd9f-a1f4b1c64233-0
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.300
Hand back to Ankit.

d7c7e222-1fd2-4028-b16d-03a53e6d1469-0
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:35.321
Oh, well, I think with one
minute to go, we are pretty much

d7c7e222-1fd2-4028-b16d-03a53e6d1469-1
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:39.033
at the end. Um, any any final
comments from yourself, Diana,

d7c7e222-1fd2-4028-b16d-03a53e6d1469-2
00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:42.197
before we close? Yeah, I mean
just from your timing

d7c7e222-1fd2-4028-b16d-03a53e6d1469-3
00:37:42.197 --> 00:37:45.665
perspective, when are you
looking to really have this up

d7c7e222-1fd2-4028-b16d-03a53e6d1469-4
00:37:45.665 --> 00:37:48.100
and running with all the
functionality?

809dd756-8263-48c1-acb3-31db64bb9487-0
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:50.860
Ready to go?

130ad699-f932-481f-9fa7-a451590ed03c-0
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.370
Roughly Q4Q3Q3 to Q4 next year
roughly.

2f5ab001-94b6-46b1-84b8-e7327ba6aa86-0
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.136
But that that'll just be for
evaluate farmer only

2f5ab001-94b6-46b1-84b8-e7327ba6aa86-1
00:38:05.136 --> 00:38:08.418
subscribers. So I think for um,
I imagine Johnson and Johnson

2f5ab001-94b6-46b1-84b8-e7327ba6aa86-2
00:38:08.418 --> 00:38:09.160
has more than.

b1096e9c-d676-4f0b-b098-d4cc81140920-0
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.400
Just just evaluate farmer um
products subscriptions, so you

b1096e9c-d676-4f0b-b098-d4cc81140920-1
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.070
might be in a slightly later
migration wave.

d03f5e27-90bb-43af-8b8d-34278985f6a9-0
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:17.990
Um.

d1e77278-5a4b-4d54-9000-42bab1dc84f6-0
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.870
But yeah.

5e0361ae-458b-4f81-acd0-49dd7713a8e1-0
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:21.850
OK.

3a8f716a-7990-42f2-959e-c27ff2c19e0a-0
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.843
I just want the report
functionality because the way I

3a8f716a-7990-42f2-959e-c27ff2c19e0a-1
00:38:26.843 --> 00:38:29.925
have to get my save reports now
is a pain in the neck. That's

3a8f716a-7990-42f2-959e-c27ff2c19e0a-2
00:38:29.925 --> 00:38:32.956
why I was asking. Plus it's I
like the visual, you know, I I

3a8f716a-7990-42f2-959e-c27ff2c19e0a-3
00:38:32.956 --> 00:38:36.237
think you guys are doing a great
job and I think you're moving in

3a8f716a-7990-42f2-959e-c27ff2c19e0a-4
00:38:36.237 --> 00:38:39.269
the direction that people want
because I put slides together

3a8f716a-7990-42f2-959e-c27ff2c19e0a-5
00:38:39.269 --> 00:38:42.450
now. Nobody wants bullet points
on the slide. Everybody wants a

3a8f716a-7990-42f2-959e-c27ff2c19e0a-6
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.139
nice little picture of
something.

8f2ea7b5-fbc8-4ae3-9e56-4deb6d7eb710-0
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.880
So you're definitely, you know,
definitely going to be extremely

8f2ea7b5-fbc8-4ae3-9e56-4deb6d7eb710-1
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.951
useful. So thank you and thank
you for, you know, he's

8f2ea7b5-fbc8-4ae3-9e56-4deb6d7eb710-2
00:38:51.951 --> 00:38:54.800
including me and allowing me to
give my two cents.

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-0
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.723
No, I appreciate you being so
engaged and active, um, and

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-1
00:38:58.723 --> 00:39:01.787
speaking to us per concept
release. So that is incredibly

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-2
00:39:01.787 --> 00:39:04.904
helpful. So what I'll do, I'll
follow up. Um, just with an

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-3
00:39:04.904 --> 00:39:08.074
e-mail, UM, why I would also
encourage you to do is just go

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-4
00:39:08.074 --> 00:39:11.402
into the platform and test it
out yourself. I know you've done

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-5
00:39:11.402 --> 00:39:14.677
that previously as well. So it's
the same way. You've got the

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-6
00:39:14.677 --> 00:39:17.952
evaluate beta button and the
feedback runs in the same way as

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-7
00:39:17.952 --> 00:39:21.281
well. You've got a little purple
sort of feedback icon. Um, if

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-8
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:24.609
you find that, you know we've
spoken and you've given a lot of

56bc00ab-a492-4203-ba64-fc6c82c9efcd-9
00:39:24.609 --> 00:39:25.560
feedback on those.

2c518f53-d6f5-4a48-824c-b10acadb28c5-0
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.800
Questions during the survey.
Then just feel free to drop me

2c518f53-d6f5-4a48-824c-b10acadb28c5-1
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.971
an e-mail if you find that
easier. More than happy. Just to

2c518f53-d6f5-4a48-824c-b10acadb28c5-2
00:39:31.971 --> 00:39:35.300
take your additional feedback on
e-mail as well. That's that's

2c518f53-d6f5-4a48-824c-b10acadb28c5-3
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.630
all good. Um, but yeah, that's
it. So we'll hope hope to reach

2c518f53-d6f5-4a48-824c-b10acadb28c5-4
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.853
out in a few months with some
more functionality. OK, great.

2c518f53-d6f5-4a48-824c-b10acadb28c5-5
00:39:41.853 --> 00:39:45.130
Thanks guys. Enjoy the rest of
your day. Thank you too. Enjoy

2c518f53-d6f5-4a48-824c-b10acadb28c5-6
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.980
your day. Cheers. Cheers. Bye
bye.
