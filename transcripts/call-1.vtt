eaba48af-ba4d-4649-8573-02552246990a-0
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.700
The platform through its.

ac7b7a70-0f94-4288-995b-bfca196904f3-0
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.037
I mean, every other people have
access to it, but I'll probably

ac7b7a70-0f94-4288-995b-bfca196904f3-1
00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:14.115
be the one doing the heavy duty
testing. Perfect. So we have to

ac7b7a70-0f94-4288-995b-bfca196904f3-2
00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:15.389
hear what you sorry.

401ed677-44ba-44a6-90f8-5ff5b5f88b3d-0
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.510
Would be great to hear what you
what you think Judis.

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-0
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.437
Um, perfect. Cool. So yeah, just
to point out, myself and Magda,

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-1
00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:27.573
we're not. We're not developers.
Um, we've not built the platform

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-2
00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:30.660
ourselves. So yeah, a couple of
things. I would encourage you to

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-3
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.463
be very open and honest. You're
not gonna offend myself or

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-4
00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:36.218
Magda. The only thing we're
doing is we're obtaining your

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-5
00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:39.211
feedback and we're just passing
it to the right people. So say

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-6
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:42.109
what you want, and the second
thing is speak out loud. Don't

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-7
00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.149
you know you don't need to wait
for us to pause for you to give

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-8
00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.667
feedback. If you want to say
something, if you think

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-9
00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:50.659
something, just say out loud.
That's the kind of feedback that

48e4ec71-3d12-4636-bfca-3cabbe72dbae-10
00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:51.040
we want.

1c7c8ac9-6002-4685-bc87-6adaedb228f3-0
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.389
That's fine. I don't wanna talk
over people. It's, I tell it too

1c7c8ac9-6002-4685-bc87-6adaedb228f3-1
00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.210
easy to do it. So I may just
raise my hand. No problem. No

1c7c8ac9-6002-4685-bc87-6adaedb228f3-2
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.225
problem. That's cool. That's
cool, cool. So maybe if we start

1c7c8ac9-6002-4685-bc87-6adaedb228f3-3
00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:07.305
by if you could explain maybe a
little bit about your role and

1c7c8ac9-6002-4685-bc87-6adaedb228f3-4
00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:11.061
how you use evaluate and then
Magda wants, once I've done

1c7c8ac9-6002-4685-bc87-6adaedb228f3-5
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:14.623
that, you want to maybe share
your screen and show the

1c7c8ac9-6002-4685-bc87-6adaedb228f3-6
00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:16.889
platform. Yeah, sounds good.
Cool.

85302ce9-0f3e-4817-868b-4527759562c9-0
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.480
You're just, you wanna go, OK.
You know we are a contract

85302ce9-0f3e-4817-868b-4527759562c9-1
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.731
development manufacturing
organization. So we may tend to

85302ce9-0f3e-4817-868b-4527759562c9-2
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:31.836
use the platform a little
differently than the the big,

85302ce9-0f3e-4817-868b-4527759562c9-3
00:01:31.836 --> 00:01:36.380
big and little bio pharmas. But
we utilize a lot of different

85302ce9-0f3e-4817-868b-4527759562c9-4
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.264
segments, modules of the
platform. We're looking for

85302ce9-0f3e-4817-868b-4527759562c9-5
00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:44.735
sales for market size. We we
look at the Omnium data, Omnium

85302ce9-0f3e-4817-868b-4527759562c9-6
00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:48.400
risk data for input into some of
our forecasting.

c5c65efd-ef94-4a20-b6e3-ccd743fe8a6c-0
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.262
Models, we are now just started
using the return data and we're

c5c65efd-ef94-4a20-b6e3-ccd743fe8a6c-1
00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:57.885
we're developing use cases for
that across our group. We have

c5c65efd-ef94-4a20-b6e3-ccd743fe8a6c-2
00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:02.285
done a little bit with it for
business development finding

c5c65efd-ef94-4a20-b6e3-ccd743fe8a6c-3
00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:06.684
business develop and we'll
probably be able to use some of

c5c65efd-ef94-4a20-b6e3-ccd743fe8a6c-4
00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:10.636
the peak sales data as a
triangulation and and where

c5c65efd-ef94-4a20-b6e3-ccd743fe8a6c-5
00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:14.514
there's a gap for private
companies because there's

c5c65efd-ef94-4a20-b6e3-ccd743fe8a6c-6
00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:18.690
there's no not a lot of there's
only reported sales so.

e66b9853-558a-430f-ae5c-b46ce49e18c0-0
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.236
Where we don't have any
forecasts, we could possibly

e66b9853-558a-430f-ae5c-b46ce49e18c0-1
00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:26.202
look at using some of the peak
sales in Omnium return. So we

e66b9853-558a-430f-ae5c-b46ce49e18c0-2
00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:29.843
work very closely with
marketing, business development,

e66b9853-558a-430f-ae5c-b46ce49e18c0-3
00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:33.679
IE sales and strategy. We're
Cornell and I are part of the

e66b9853-558a-430f-ae5c-b46ce49e18c0-4
00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:34.980
strategy department.

3d95d464-fae2-49de-a3c3-346055798934-0
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.780
In addition, I would say one of
the main.

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-0
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.240
So we use this to look at
aggregate markets. You know we

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-1
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.264
use this to look at individual
products as well. You know we

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-2
00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:53.090
produce now just under 8000
products for our customers in

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-3
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.114
the market, in the market. So
understanding what's happening

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-4
00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.809
to our customers products is
useful to us. They give us

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-5
00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:04.899
forecasts but they're not always
you know there are different

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-6
00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.055
forecasts and companies and we
always get the procurement ones

9c722bd6-a7fc-4f2b-bf1d-67222a2efe2a-7
00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.420
which are tend to be making sure
they have enough.

92c4b2fa-992a-4ad1-a673-ccde47c0543a-0
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.407
Rather than the you know IR ones
that are making sure they don't

92c4b2fa-992a-4ad1-a673-ccde47c0543a-1
00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:25.515
get caught by by surprises so so
so we use you know the data for

92c4b2fa-992a-4ad1-a673-ccde47c0543a-2
00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:30.965
triangulation for you know
customer forecast for products

92c4b2fa-992a-4ad1-a673-ccde47c0543a-3
00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.690
as well and then some of the.

991d4edf-560a-421e-a4b8-4bd8c263d554-0
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.990
Umm.

fdde9528-02bc-436e-b6e3-041d7f1c0570-0
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.891
You know there, there are, there
are ways we have used some of

fdde9528-02bc-436e-b6e3-041d7f1c0570-1
00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:46.036
the other data sets you know the
the Clinton Trials Registry data

fdde9528-02bc-436e-b6e3-041d7f1c0570-2
00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:47.830
sets the, you know FDA.

d8aad14e-788a-4b1c-98aa-455545e73ef8-0
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.232
You know the FDA drugs that FDA
type datasets um as well over

d8aad14e-788a-4b1c-98aa-455545e73ef8-1
00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:57.640
over time. So there are very few
pieces.

09315ab0-f6d5-4406-8a2d-daadaeaf7df6-0
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.702
There are pieces, but there are
very relatively very few pieces

09315ab0-f6d5-4406-8a2d-daadaeaf7df6-1
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:08.784
to which we have access that we
haven't used. We did have access

09315ab0-f6d5-4406-8a2d-daadaeaf7df6-2
00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:13.474
to API's and you know, we're
less. We found we found issues

09315ab0-f6d5-4406-8a2d-daadaeaf7df6-3
00:04:13.474 --> 00:04:18.399
with the data set at the time,
so we moved away from that, but

09315ab0-f6d5-4406-8a2d-daadaeaf7df6-4
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.650
that's the only.

906b8392-0d54-4ada-aea2-f4ccf7ce1f78-0
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.220
Issue we've we've had so.

6daea89b-e454-4ca1-a0ba-5b498c369f04-0
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.658
And we have used it for various
initiatives for targeting and

6daea89b-e454-4ca1-a0ba-5b498c369f04-1
00:04:28.658 --> 00:04:33.139
things like that. For pipeline,
we tend to focus on pharma

6daea89b-e454-4ca1-a0ba-5b498c369f04-2
00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.999
projects which will now be more
in your bailiwick. One piece of

6daea89b-e454-4ca1-a0ba-5b498c369f04-3
00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:42.479
advice, I just keep telling
everyone that we want to see a

6daea89b-e454-4ca1-a0ba-5b498c369f04-4
00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.264
simple user interface such as
farmer projects has. Now I don't

6daea89b-e454-4ca1-a0ba-5b498c369f04-5
00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:51.896
know how the plans are, how to
integrate it, but it needs to

6daea89b-e454-4ca1-a0ba-5b498c369f04-6
00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:52.959
have a simple.

df4232ef-da4e-4c9f-8d9a-6df8dce5c68b-0
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.152
Um, user-friendly interface that
the drug mapping is excellent in

df4232ef-da4e-4c9f-8d9a-6df8dce5c68b-1
00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:01.840
pharma projects. You don't need
to know what name you're going

df4232ef-da4e-4c9f-8d9a-6df8dce5c68b-2
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.234
with, you just need to have a
name that's very useful for

df4232ef-da4e-4c9f-8d9a-6df8dce5c68b-3
00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:08.629
people who are not heavy duty
users. I heard the plans to

df4232ef-da4e-4c9f-8d9a-6df8dce5c68b-4
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.024
changing some of the taxonomy,
getting rid of some of the

df4232ef-da4e-4c9f-8d9a-6df8dce5c68b-5
00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:15.360
biotech from the therapeutic
class and putting it in the

df4232ef-da4e-4c9f-8d9a-6df8dce5c68b-6
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.770
origin.

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-0
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.578
So those things we will be
watching closely moving forward.

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-1
00:05:20.578 --> 00:05:24.586
Yeah. And you know I I don't
think that the purpose of this

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-2
00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:28.528
call was to talk about the
integration of the information,

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-3
00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:32.670
but I just, I just keep saying
that but but I'll echo that to

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-4
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.679
Farmer project plays a even more
important role for us than

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-5
00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:40.954
evaluate does and we have broad
broad access in the company for

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-6
00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:45.163
that. Don't screw it up is my
ask to review management and you

ea302a0e-37e8-451c-88e4-a8e424391663-7
00:05:45.163 --> 00:05:46.499
know the quality of.

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-0
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.901
That is so much better than the
pipeline data and evaluate right

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-1
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:54.100
now at an at an aggregate
company level not the

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-2
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.231
individual. Well, even at an
individual level you know you if

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-3
00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:02.096
you look at your pipeline
project counts, you know you're

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-4
00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:06.028
duplicating projects across
different companies and things

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-5
00:06:06.028 --> 00:06:09.826
like that. So the farmer
projects is gold standard data.

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-6
00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:14.224
So please if you're going to use
it move that direction and don't

322f08c3-70bf-42dd-b78d-56cb7f28708e-7
00:06:14.224 --> 00:06:16.890
move them your direction because
it'll.

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-0
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.792
It'll it'll be a problem for us,
but that's a different,

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-1
00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:24.460
different point. This is
actually really useful honest

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-2
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.129
feedback which we really
appreciate. We are doing some

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-3
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:32.465
work in the early stage pipeline
space, so hopefully you will be

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-4
00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:36.867
able to see some of the changes.
And then in terms of API kernel,

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-5
00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:40.869
you mentioned there were some
issues, so you no longer have

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-6
00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:45.005
the subscription. We have also
made some changes recently and

344f6d9e-d08c-4ed4-9770-77b737381808-7
00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:47.140
we have mapped the epidemiology.

7fe2f9f4-fb4b-48e7-9b1c-63f585a2fb9c-0
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.238
Data to evaluate indications and
detailed indications. So maybe I

7fe2f9f4-fb4b-48e7-9b1c-63f585a2fb9c-1
00:06:51.238 --> 00:06:54.587
could get you in touch with
someone who could walk you

7fe2f9f4-fb4b-48e7-9b1c-63f585a2fb9c-2
00:06:54.587 --> 00:06:58.545
through it and you could see if
maybe that kind of data analysis

7fe2f9f4-fb4b-48e7-9b1c-63f585a2fb9c-3
00:06:58.545 --> 00:06:59.520
is available is.

fdddcafc-533f-4230-b74c-343b241b4d7d-0
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.595
Something useful for for
yourself. OK. You know we can

fdddcafc-533f-4230-b74c-343b241b4d7d-1
00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:07.150
Judith we we've had.

7eb328e7-0ddc-4af0-a211-7193887d204c-0
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.052
Judith, I don't remember the the
contacts at the time, but you

7eb328e7-0ddc-4af0-a211-7193887d204c-1
00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:17.035
know, we did a kind of a special
data poll and you know,

7eb328e7-0ddc-4af0-a211-7193887d204c-2
00:07:17.035 --> 00:07:20.110
communicated back the issues
that we found.

8b65148f-24e8-406d-b885-a259e60c2862-0
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.190
Mapping issues to the correct
level, it was also they were

8b65148f-24e8-406d-b885-a259e60c2862-1
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.277
pulling it from the back end. So
I I think that what you're just

8b65148f-24e8-406d-b885-a259e60c2862-2
00:07:29.277 --> 00:07:33.050
saying about improving the
mapping of the indications could

8b65148f-24e8-406d-b885-a259e60c2862-3
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.886
be a valuable improvement that
we would want to say yes, OK,

8b65148f-24e8-406d-b885-a259e60c2862-4
00:07:36.886 --> 00:07:38.710
perfect. I'll get someone to.

f620f60e-06fd-4b00-8042-5bce4fc3b99c-0
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.220
To get in touch with you then.

185b2a57-3e3b-497b-ab14-3ef01e2e5a9a-0
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.340
OK, cool. So we jump on to the
the new platform now.

db87d101-7e4b-4c0e-8726-8e0b730e641a-0
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.251
Awesome. Let me just share my
screen quickly and just to just

db87d101-7e4b-4c0e-8726-8e0b730e641a-1
00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:55.410
to be clear, just if you did
mention.

b0d36dfb-06c0-437d-b7d9-c0af5fde4969-0
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.279
You know in terms of data that
you you will be watching very

b0d36dfb-06c0-437d-b7d9-c0af5fde4969-1
00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.900
closely how the data changes.

ee33ad5d-3f4a-4fca-ae55-838b74878a56-0
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.700
When it comes to the new
platform, the data stays the

ee33ad5d-3f4a-4fca-ae55-838b74878a56-1
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.502
same. So whatever changes we are
going to do in terms of taxonomy

ee33ad5d-3f4a-4fca-ae55-838b74878a56-2
00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:13.189
that's that's separate project.
So whatever the data we have at

ee33ad5d-3f4a-4fca-ae55-838b74878a56-3
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:16.530
evaluate that's going to be
migrated strictly straight to

ee33ad5d-3f4a-4fca-ae55-838b74878a56-4
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.739
the new platform, so.

97779d78-4487-42ed-851b-97ba93b05f2e-0
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.370
Don't worry, there you will
still be able to see the same

97779d78-4487-42ed-851b-97ba93b05f2e-1
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.023
data. So at the moment the new
platform can be accessed through

97779d78-4487-42ed-851b-97ba93b05f2e-2
00:08:26.023 --> 00:08:29.562
the beta button that you have
available and then as you click

97779d78-4487-42ed-851b-97ba93b05f2e-3
00:08:29.562 --> 00:08:31.560
through that link it takes you
to.

a6c9114a-e6fe-4897-83ce-f1870a0cdce7-0
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.330
To our new home page.

be2fde44-d0f8-44fe-bb13-a8c1d4491718-0
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.057
So we are at this stage of
testing, so you get a little pop

be2fde44-d0f8-44fe-bb13-a8c1d4491718-1
00:08:39.057 --> 00:08:43.151
up here, but yeah so this is the
let me just make it smaller so

be2fde44-d0f8-44fe-bb13-a8c1d4491718-2
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:46.030
you can see the whole thing. So
this is the.

b7c48dd5-8bfa-427f-bef5-81a54fb658cc-0
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.220
The landing page.

44f27cdd-17d9-4919-b6c8-6f5e0d887ad1-0
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.252
Some of those things are
placeholders to give you an idea

44f27cdd-17d9-4919-b6c8-6f5e0d887ad1-1
00:08:53.252 --> 00:08:57.263
what it will look like when it's
fully built. So at the moment

44f27cdd-17d9-4919-b6c8-6f5e0d887ad1-2
00:08:57.263 --> 00:09:01.082
some of those things are just to
give you a little bit of a

44f27cdd-17d9-4919-b6c8-6f5e0d887ad1-3
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:04.966
preview what we are thinking
about like news Market Explorer

44f27cdd-17d9-4919-b6c8-6f5e0d887ad1-4
00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:09.040
and then quick links and things
like that. At the moment we are

44f27cdd-17d9-4919-b6c8-6f5e0d887ad1-5
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.550
able to.

97bfc2c7-547a-480f-a2bc-29742f7920cc-0
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.950
Sorry.

55a055ca-d483-4ddd-a94a-99b2e2c24ce2-0
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.017
Sorry I thought someone said
something. Um, so at the moment

55a055ca-d483-4ddd-a94a-99b2e2c24ce2-1
00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:21.202
we are able to access the data
via 2 routes. So we can either

55a055ca-d483-4ddd-a94a-99b2e2c24ce2-2
00:09:21.202 --> 00:09:25.522
create a report from scratch by
clicking through here or we can

55a055ca-d483-4ddd-a94a-99b2e2c24ce2-3
00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:29.370
go through the menu button and
go to specific pages. So.

84e63c2b-acc7-4437-a3d6-349c0d40c879-0
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.568
Before I jump onto the creating
a report, just wanted to point

84e63c2b-acc7-4437-a3d6-349c0d40c879-1
00:09:35.568 --> 00:09:40.080
out that when you save your
reports they will be available

84e63c2b-acc7-4437-a3d6-349c0d40c879-2
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.440
here in the order of which one
you have saved or edited.

2af755e7-4f95-4ad6-8e01-3785e0df2d58-0
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.930
Recently, most recently so. So
this is going to give you a

2af755e7-4f95-4ad6-8e01-3785e0df2d58-1
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.340
quick.

0f118470-bd76-40dc-b942-fff2685699ee-0
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:57.015
Quick access to to your reports
as well. So um yeah, before I

0f118470-bd76-40dc-b942-fff2685699ee-1
00:09:57.015 --> 00:10:01.604
click on the create a new report
button, is there anything that

0f118470-bd76-40dc-b942-fff2685699ee-2
00:10:01.604 --> 00:10:05.835
you would like to give us
feedback on when it comes to the

0f118470-bd76-40dc-b942-fff2685699ee-3
00:10:05.835 --> 00:10:07.700
landing page here I would.

d44eb2c4-c221-4ee5-b80a-1c210629a2d2-0
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.550
You know the.

8962f531-34ba-4051-b27d-b4e298a7fe9a-0
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.740
The ease of being able to click
through the current.

ddedc385-6a08-4dbc-8e0e-0c1114b08896-0
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.387
Data dimensions in the current
menu. You know the current

ddedc385-6a08-4dbc-8e0e-0c1114b08896-1
00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:26.174
landing page menu structure and
find the sub report the sub

ddedc385-6a08-4dbc-8e0e-0c1114b08896-2
00:10:26.174 --> 00:10:27.930
section that you need.

245973ef-5d5a-42ce-bbc6-2755c391eece-0
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.191
Is is easy and even in today's
like browse feature which is

245973ef-5d5a-42ce-bbc6-2755c391eece-1
00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:39.512
this looks similar to the browse
feature, very difficult to find

245973ef-5d5a-42ce-bbc6-2755c391eece-2
00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:44.833
some of those subsections in the
way that it's very easy to find

245973ef-5d5a-42ce-bbc6-2755c391eece-3
00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:49.418
them in the other current
landing page. So we have this

245973ef-5d5a-42ce-bbc6-2755c391eece-4
00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:54.248
issue, I'll say sorry, this
reminds me of an issue we have

245973ef-5d5a-42ce-bbc6-2755c391eece-5
00:10:54.248 --> 00:10:59.160
with other datasets that are
designed for product managers.

40ccbadd-d8f3-4f83-9969-013d2d3c0389-0
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.613
That when you get to the landing
page you primarily care about

40ccbadd-d8f3-4f83-9969-013d2d3c0389-1
00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:08.624
one therapeutic area or one
product or whatever and so you

40ccbadd-d8f3-4f83-9969-013d2d3c0389-2
00:11:08.624 --> 00:11:13.044
have the heavy graph and things
like that. We don't use the data

40ccbadd-d8f3-4f83-9969-013d2d3c0389-3
00:11:13.044 --> 00:11:17.463
set that way because we have to
we we basically make products in

40ccbadd-d8f3-4f83-9969-013d2d3c0389-4
00:11:17.463 --> 00:11:21.339
nearly every therapeutic
category for customers you know

40ccbadd-d8f3-4f83-9969-013d2d3c0389-5
00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:25.486
and and and for thousands of
companies and things like that.

40ccbadd-d8f3-4f83-9969-013d2d3c0389-6
00:11:25.486 --> 00:11:29.429
So we don't have that luxury and
so spending all the the.

52533ad0-e80f-402c-afbd-a2017280bfbc-0
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.886
I'm focusing on a few things
instead and and making it more

52533ad0-e80f-402c-afbd-a2017280bfbc-1
00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:37.860
difficult for us to get to
individual pieces because I

52533ad0-e80f-402c-afbd-a2017280bfbc-2
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.907
don't want to have to create a
report every time I need

52533ad0-e80f-402c-afbd-a2017280bfbc-3
00:11:41.907 --> 00:11:46.171
something, you know, and we
can't, at least in the current

52533ad0-e80f-402c-afbd-a2017280bfbc-4
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:50.435
browse. So I didn't look at
this. In the current browse we

52533ad0-e80f-402c-afbd-a2017280bfbc-5
00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:54.626
can't get to all of those
subsets very easily, easily and

52533ad0-e80f-402c-afbd-a2017280bfbc-6
00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:58.239
very quickly. This would make my
my usage harder.

a060d11a-3c13-4567-b6fb-353059a126fe-0
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.990
OK, personal opinion so.

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-0
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.534
Even having the option of, you
know, using either interface

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-1
00:12:06.534 --> 00:12:09.469
would be nice. You know, there
might be times when this

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-2
00:12:09.469 --> 00:12:12.352
interface would be better,
especially if we could say,

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-3
00:12:12.352 --> 00:12:15.759
look, we're, you know, we could
build a custom, you know, custom

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-4
00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:18.694
market and it's only the
products we make or something,

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-5
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:21.943
you know, whatever. You know,
maybe there would be times that

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-6
00:12:21.943 --> 00:12:25.140
would be valuable, but I I'd
hate to lose the flexibility of

96280ee9-1069-4705-b7fc-1a94e2e942e0-7
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.560
the old.

3f6ce4c6-5cdb-4611-8bf5-05ec38c1e2c2-0
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.560
Drill down to.

2cbd2b06-c8c7-410e-81de-8159eae233ce-0
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.236
Yeah, one thing that I think
he's alluding to, you can see

2cbd2b06-c8c7-410e-81de-8159eae233ce-1
00:12:32.236 --> 00:12:35.543
the structure of everything. You
can see all the different

2cbd2b06-c8c7-410e-81de-8159eae233ce-2
00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:39.242
modules and what's available and
maybe that's in the menu section

2cbd2b06-c8c7-410e-81de-8159eae233ce-3
00:12:39.242 --> 00:12:42.605
a little bit more. But even
though it's a little complex, I

2cbd2b06-c8c7-410e-81de-8159eae233ce-4
00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:46.136
think in looking at all those
modules, if you're familiar with

2cbd2b06-c8c7-410e-81de-8159eae233ce-5
00:12:46.136 --> 00:12:49.611
it, you know where it is you
want to go and you can get to it

2cbd2b06-c8c7-410e-81de-8159eae233ce-6
00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:50.340
very quickly.

85995c6a-4f27-4dc1-883c-14e07ec10a11-0
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.843
Cornell said. We work across not
only all therapeutic areas but

85995c6a-4f27-4dc1-883c-14e07ec10a11-1
00:12:56.843 --> 00:13:01.038
all modalities. So we do
manufacture small molecule

85995c6a-4f27-4dc1-883c-14e07ec10a11-2
00:13:01.038 --> 00:13:05.718
biologics and cell and gene
therapies. So there isn't one

85995c6a-4f27-4dc1-883c-14e07ec10a11-3
00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:08.300
specific niche that we focus on.

ea4ffc52-3a83-49e1-a953-d82dade76bfe-0
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.530
OK, understood. So you mean that
in in terms of here for example

ea4ffc52-3a83-49e1-a953-d82dade76bfe-1
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.057
you would want to see um a quick
links to therapeutic category

ea4ffc52-3a83-49e1-a953-d82dade76bfe-2
00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:23.584
and then you can drill through
specific ones or indications is

ea4ffc52-3a83-49e1-a953-d82dade76bfe-3
00:13:23.584 --> 00:13:26.889
that is that what I'm hearing
that you would?

5fef8108-97f9-4833-b68f-5e29225bbe17-0
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.820
So can you click on the first
tab?

7cda4312-28e2-463a-a96f-24ecf731019f-0
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.930
Click on the first step. There
you go. Just the old interface

7cda4312-28e2-463a-a96f-24ecf731019f-1
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.710
tab. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah. So, you know, I, I most

7cda4312-28e2-463a-a96f-24ecf731019f-2
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.568
often use drugs. Tab, a valued
Omnia, you know, and here I can

7cda4312-28e2-463a-a96f-24ecf731019f-3
00:13:45.568 --> 00:13:50.117
go to, you know, one click
because it normally lands here.

7cda4312-28e2-463a-a96f-24ecf731019f-4
00:13:50.117 --> 00:13:55.128
So one click, I can go to global
analysis, you know, you know, I

7cda4312-28e2-463a-a96f-24ecf731019f-5
00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:55.899
can go to.

630926eb-3ac5-47d5-9893-579e152ed2de-0
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.670
You know some of the some of
these other cuts, so they're not

630926eb-3ac5-47d5-9893-579e152ed2de-1
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.093
analogy. I often go in
technology, you know, I can go

630926eb-3ac5-47d5-9893-579e152ed2de-2
00:14:05.093 --> 00:14:08.707
Click to the tab, click one
thing and get to kind of the

630926eb-3ac5-47d5-9893-579e152ed2de-3
00:14:08.707 --> 00:14:12.384
common set of reports if you
try. If I try to do the same

630926eb-3ac5-47d5-9893-579e152ed2de-4
00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:16.061
with browse, I often you know
which I think is similar to

630926eb-3ac5-47d5-9893-579e152ed2de-5
00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:20.181
what's in the new. I can't even
figure out how to get to some of

630926eb-3ac5-47d5-9893-579e152ed2de-6
00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:21.640
these areas and browse.

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-0
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.456
Yeah, that that does make sense
and it's really useful to to

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-1
00:14:26.456 --> 00:14:30.502
know this actually. So it will
definitely take that back to the

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-2
00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:34.548
team and I and I would describe
there, there may be, it may be,

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-3
00:14:34.548 --> 00:14:38.468
you know since I've been using
the the app so long or the NOT

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-4
00:14:38.468 --> 00:14:42.577
app but the service so long. You
know, I tend to think of myself

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-5
00:14:42.577 --> 00:14:46.307
as a power user and that it may
be a difference between an

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-6
00:14:46.307 --> 00:14:50.290
average user and a power user
view or something. Yeah, I think

4d456f82-8eda-4498-a0e2-c41c946014a0-7
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:50.480
so.

7dd1b2e3-43c4-493a-9595-12f1adad4c98-0
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.069
But, but just so that's that's
kind of my should illustrate my

7dd1b2e3-43c4-493a-9595-12f1adad4c98-1
00:14:56.069 --> 00:15:00.802
feedback, but, and I have the
same reaction as Cornell, the

7dd1b2e3-43c4-493a-9595-12f1adad4c98-2
00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:01.670
browser is.

51ab26db-d9b5-4f22-87aa-75b980e977ac-0
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.525
Doesn't really help me a lot. I
like the the analyze this this

51ab26db-d9b5-4f22-87aa-75b980e977ac-1
00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:11.811
interface. I know I can go to
drugs, omnium ordeals, which is

51ab26db-d9b5-4f22-87aa-75b980e977ac-2
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.821
where I tend. Those are the
three places I tend to go and

51ab26db-d9b5-4f22-87aa-75b980e977ac-3
00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:17.550
it's everything is right.

32812988-46cf-42d5-a9fd-5b92d0b05938-0
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.223
I can see all the sections of
all the modules right there, so

32812988-46cf-42d5-a9fd-5b92d0b05938-1
00:15:22.223 --> 00:15:23.380
I know what's in it.

dc88e93c-a5ad-46eb-831f-f0d49207ea51-0
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.612
Absolutely, that does make
sense. And I guess when you're

dc88e93c-a5ad-46eb-831f-f0d49207ea51-1
00:15:28.612 --> 00:15:32.867
used to one way of finding
things, you can just do it with

dc88e93c-a5ad-46eb-831f-f0d49207ea51-2
00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:37.265
a couple of clicks, um, with
your eyes closed. Let's, let's,

dc88e93c-a5ad-46eb-831f-f0d49207ea51-3
00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:41.160
let's take an example. So say I
wanted to do a, a, A.

51827a47-3091-42b9-b0c4-b8e8a0bc4623-0
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.584
Uh global you know, global
analysis sales by technology

51827a47-3091-42b9-b0c4-b8e8a0bc4623-1
00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:49.770
forecast report in the new
interface.

63923101-4e90-4b23-b8f7-4d6b2a9a9d08-0
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.911
How would I, you know, can I
browse? Because right now I

63923101-4e90-4b23-b8f7-4d6b2a9a9d08-1
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.410
don't think you can easily
browse that so.

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-0
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.009
So that's a good question
Colonel as and you know as I

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-1
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:04.499
mentioned a lot of things are
being built and feedback like

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-2
00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:08.279
yours actually helps us. So you
know whatever you say it's going

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-3
00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:12.060
to put us on the right track. So
it's really useful to know that

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-4
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.783
this is the way that you would
start your research with without

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-5
00:16:15.783 --> 00:16:19.505
you know instead of going to a
specific thing you would want to

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-6
00:16:19.505 --> 00:16:23.170
see the full global analysis and
then you're drilling down the

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-7
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.660
idea behind this platform is for
users to be able to get as

6161327a-8cfc-4288-bbc0-ae7428e689f1-8
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.940
granular as they want.

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-0
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.180
To the data starting from the
very top. But then as you look

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-1
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.993
at this, these are all the
placeholders at the moment. So

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-2
00:16:35.993 --> 00:16:40.201
we are building and it's useful
to know if you did mention that

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-3
00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:44.146
you want to go quickly to deal
so you will be able to do it

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-4
00:16:44.146 --> 00:16:48.353
here. But it's really useful to
know which level you would want

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-5
00:16:48.353 --> 00:16:52.561
to start your analysis from as
well. So yes, thank you for that

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-6
00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:56.769
feedback. So I think this comes
back to the different user, the

9d12fcb5-5e2f-4b10-82a4-3d110cb3271a-7
00:16:56.769 --> 00:16:58.150
different user types.

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-0
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:03.056
Yeah, because you know again as
you were showing that the kind

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-1
00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:06.965
of the competitor and whatnot,
that's very much a product

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-2
00:17:06.965 --> 00:17:10.942
management centric profile and
we don't primarily use this

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-3
00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:14.986
data. We do have some people
within our user group that may

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-4
00:17:14.986 --> 00:17:19.030
use certain parts of the data
like they care about the oral

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-5
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.276
products we make or something.
But you know for for the way we

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-6
00:17:23.276 --> 00:17:27.185
use it we tend we we're not
start you know we're starting

cac8ce9d-4bdb-4730-b486-acd09ddf2aa9-7
00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:27.859
with this.

e01f0d0d-329a-4a4f-a2a0-e79d0b55f48b-0
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.320
Like with this, not with this.

ebe8288b-d82a-40f8-a06d-f06c60d3edfd-0
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.820
And so, so um, so having
something that starts.

396ed369-64d9-4440-9e9b-b3291407a1d5-0
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.380
What you say is broad, but to me
is more narrow. You know is, is

396ed369-64d9-4440-9e9b-b3291407a1d5-1
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.346
and again we're different. CDO's
would use this service different

396ed369-64d9-4440-9e9b-b3291407a1d5-2
00:17:46.346 --> 00:17:50.860
than normal product management
types. We know that or or or

396ed369-64d9-4440-9e9b-b3291407a1d5-3
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.676
than. Wall Street types too. So
when you did click on the menu,

396ed369-64d9-4440-9e9b-b3291407a1d5-4
00:17:55.676 --> 00:18:00.416
I did see some examples where
you could go straight to Omnium,

396ed369-64d9-4440-9e9b-b3291407a1d5-5
00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:01.620
straight to EPI.

2092a3fa-795b-42ce-9929-7b3919aca3ba-0
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.789
And straight to and and are
those clickable or are those

2092a3fa-795b-42ce-9929-7b3919aca3ba-1
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:10.304
just dummy links right now,
placeholders at the moment, not

2092a3fa-795b-42ce-9929-7b3919aca3ba-2
00:18:10.304 --> 00:18:14.171
right now. We can go to drugs or
companies. Well, go to drugs and

2092a3fa-795b-42ce-9929-7b3919aca3ba-3
00:18:14.171 --> 00:18:15.050
let's see what.

b0dd9bf3-e9db-4738-af09-e76b7e203cf5-0
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.310
What?

8ca484e2-9273-4836-9d42-bba787ccfb96-0
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:23.529
Because if so this is a high
level KPI so you can see the the

8ca484e2-9273-4836-9d42-bba787ccfb96-1
00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:28.919
forecast, you can see how many
drugs we've got in our in our

8ca484e2-9273-4836-9d42-bba787ccfb96-2
00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:34.310
database by phase and then a
placeholders at the moment. But

8ca484e2-9273-4836-9d42-bba787ccfb96-3
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:39.612
the recent events from event
analyzer offering and then top

8ca484e2-9273-4836-9d42-bba787ccfb96-4
00:18:39.612 --> 00:18:44.473
three by MOA indication,
therapeutic category and then

8ca484e2-9273-4836-9d42-bba787ccfb96-5
00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:47.920
the data table here that you can
edit.

4dfc6dc8-367f-47fd-b7ca-5e11693de827-0
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.430
As well.

a2c556e0-bf04-4d8c-8598-b66ce946b762-0
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.280
Yeah. So, so The thing is like
where, where would global

a2c556e0-bf04-4d8c-8598-b66ce946b762-1
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:52.770
analysis?

63696387-441f-4bfa-9d83-0edf39bbbb55-0
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.970
So that's the yeah.

323a0b34-8a8a-4503-a946-a2f5e85ea0f3-0
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.040
So the the the top level here
that's that would be the.

c077ea55-cb08-4d3b-a552-d47c31d218ca-0
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.543
The yeah that double analysis, I
don't need a dashboard that's

c077ea55-cb08-4d3b-a552-d47c31d218ca-1
00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:08.891
not what because I you know I
use evaluate probably almost

c077ea55-cb08-4d3b-a552-d47c31d218ca-2
00:19:08.891 --> 00:19:13.019
every day you know at least
every other day and I'm not

c077ea55-cb08-4d3b-a552-d47c31d218ca-3
00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:17.809
going in to say what's happened
to the pipeline yesterday versus

c077ea55-cb08-4d3b-a552-d47c31d218ca-4
00:19:17.809 --> 00:19:22.305
today that's you know or is is
worldwide sales up or down by

c077ea55-cb08-4d3b-a552-d47c31d218ca-5
00:19:22.305 --> 00:19:26.801
you know $10 million you know
forecast that's not that's not

c077ea55-cb08-4d3b-a552-d47c31d218ca-6
00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:29.749
the you know so this is using a
lot of.

b3f3b00c-da12-42c7-a57c-8b9879672a72-0
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.783
Screen real estate that I would
just have to scroll past or

b3f3b00c-da12-42c7-a57c-8b9879672a72-1
00:19:34.783 --> 00:19:39.340
click through. Yeah you know
that and and I would I would

b3f3b00c-da12-42c7-a57c-8b9879672a72-2
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.289
suspect you know unless this can
be customized to you know any

b3f3b00c-da12-42c7-a57c-8b9879672a72-3
00:19:44.289 --> 00:19:49.003
given user specific you know
category of interest that that

b3f3b00c-da12-42c7-a57c-8b9879672a72-4
00:19:49.003 --> 00:19:54.110
would probably be more frequent
than less frequent across users.

156212b9-3264-487d-9ebf-a25661604d4b-0
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.230
I agree, unless if there's a way
to uh.

502da660-7c88-41ed-bbd7-d437140193ab-0
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.372
Customize it for maybe a
project, projects that you're

502da660-7c88-41ed-bbd7-d437140193ab-1
00:20:02.372 --> 00:20:05.400
working on or you're a constant
things that you're looking at.

4f32ed86-3e9c-4436-b2fb-2e498037b6b2-0
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.520
Not mechanism, different
attributes.

273ee493-3658-4364-8be5-594dfbc528ea-0
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.846
Um, that possibly could be
useful, but yeah, uh, we're

273ee493-3658-4364-8be5-594dfbc528ea-1
00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:17.638
using it usually to answer
specific questions. So we, you

273ee493-3658-4364-8be5-594dfbc528ea-2
00:20:17.638 --> 00:20:21.299
know, a lot of times there's a
lot of data involved not

273ee493-3658-4364-8be5-594dfbc528ea-3
00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:25.157
necessarily going, sometimes
we're going in to look at one

273ee493-3658-4364-8be5-594dfbc528ea-4
00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.230
compound, but often it's, it's a
broader view.

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-0
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.085
Understood. That's really useful
feedback. Is there anything

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-1
00:20:33.085 --> 00:20:36.850
specific that you would rather
see here instead of those? Then

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-2
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.436
what would you, what would be
your ideal case scenario? You

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-3
00:20:40.436 --> 00:20:43.902
click through drugs and then
what would you would want to

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-4
00:20:43.902 --> 00:20:47.787
see? Well, you know what, what I
thinking about some other apps,

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-5
00:20:47.787 --> 00:20:51.552
applications that we use, you
know the way to look at either a

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-6
00:20:51.552 --> 00:20:55.197
dashboard or like a research
view, you know, so maybe having

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-7
00:20:55.197 --> 00:20:59.082
the option of saying, OK, I want
to look at the big picture once

13913742-4ad9-4ea0-b803-8dfd98c5077f-8
00:20:59.082 --> 00:20:59.740
in a while.

dfd9131b-3b01-4695-bb40-606e2ee19613-0
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.281
For whatever reason, you know
being able to go this way um,

dfd9131b-3b01-4695-bb40-606e2ee19613-1
00:21:04.281 --> 00:21:08.976
but um, but like having having
dashboards be optional or opt in

dfd9131b-3b01-4695-bb40-606e2ee19613-2
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:13.524
or something instead of it being
mandatory, yeah, we would be

dfd9131b-3b01-4695-bb40-606e2ee19613-3
00:21:13.524 --> 00:21:17.338
more interested in it in in
data, some sort of data

dfd9131b-3b01-4695-bb40-606e2ee19613-4
00:21:17.338 --> 00:21:21.300
visualization, dashboard graphs
after we run a query.

38276b8a-9c5a-4f58-a70d-35f561759d9d-0
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.889
And then seeing what the data is
showing us like you know farmer

38276b8a-9c5a-4f58-a70d-35f561759d9d-1
00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:29.600
projects right now is very very
very basic dashboards, some bar

38276b8a-9c5a-4f58-a70d-35f561759d9d-2
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.079
graphs and and a few other
things. But you know building on

38276b8a-9c5a-4f58-a70d-35f561759d9d-3
00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:36.443
that kind of thing you run a
query you, you, you have the

38276b8a-9c5a-4f58-a70d-35f561759d9d-4
00:21:36.443 --> 00:21:40.096
data if there is, you know data
manipulation, visualization on

38276b8a-9c5a-4f58-a70d-35f561759d9d-5
00:21:40.096 --> 00:21:41.429
the query that you ran.

10a111b6-03de-4f22-a4fe-eb9cdba8af95-0
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.540
That would be useful.

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-0
00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.058
And or taking you know reports
you develop, queries you ran,

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-1
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:52.592
you know, being able to adapt
that to a a user defined

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-2
00:21:52.592 --> 00:21:56.704
dashboard. You know, so I I only
want to look at, you know, the

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-3
00:21:56.704 --> 00:22:00.751
8000 kind of products, not that
they're all in evaluate, but I

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-4
00:22:00.751 --> 00:22:04.799
only want to look at the 8000
products that Catalent produces.

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-5
00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:08.846
So we, you know, run a report we
then link that to a dashboard

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-6
00:22:08.846 --> 00:22:12.701
and that's my user defined
dashboard maybe. I know that's a

64ccaa31-0fe8-4a7a-9257-8d6406f949af-7
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:14.949
like different order of
magnitude.

3149375a-5800-4181-9683-4ae7e344b0b4-0
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.490
Complexity for programming
purposes, I get that, but.

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-0
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.840
You know anyway I think we I
could see people in OPS who why

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-1
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.843
would we be tracking certain
things subset like Cornell

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-2
00:22:27.843 --> 00:22:31.845
saying and maybe having a
dashboard for that. In fact I

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-3
00:22:31.845 --> 00:22:36.349
was at one point you utilizing
evaluate data we were developed

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-4
00:22:36.349 --> 00:22:40.351
I was working with one of our
office people for them to

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-5
00:22:40.351 --> 00:22:44.926
develop their own dashboard with
the data. So they may actually

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-6
00:22:44.926 --> 00:22:49.286
want something where they could
see that but that's that's a

3150095a-dd01-45ab-ac55-d8e2dd43881d-7
00:22:49.286 --> 00:22:49.930
tactical.

151c2e79-1d03-4eb3-9686-785a37d4a41e-0
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.828
Operational thing versus a
strategy thing, so two

151c2e79-1d03-4eb3-9686-785a37d4a41e-1
00:22:52.828 --> 00:22:53.390
different.

c249c3b6-22e5-49d5-9018-a23485aaeb52-0
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.310
Use cases.

c82000f6-f15c-468c-9925-760e54296f90-0
00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.026
Understood. Um, so OK, so in
that case, would you would you

c82000f6-f15c-468c-9925-760e54296f90-1
00:23:01.026 --> 00:23:05.812
like if we had a function here
that you can filter this data to

c82000f6-f15c-468c-9925-760e54296f90-2
00:23:05.812 --> 00:23:10.522
a specific segment that you are
interested in and then have it

c82000f6-f15c-468c-9925-760e54296f90-3
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:14.859
saved so whenever you click
through the menu to go to the

c82000f6-f15c-468c-9925-760e54296f90-4
00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:19.346
drugs page, then you will see
whatever you filtered on last

c82000f6-f15c-468c-9925-760e54296f90-5
00:23:19.346 --> 00:23:19.720
time?

0c8fc6e0-8ce5-4743-919d-4d80b4bc39f1-0
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.026
It would make it more, make this
view more useful, but it would

0c8fc6e0-8ce5-4743-919d-4d80b4bc39f1-1
00:23:28.026 --> 00:23:33.306
still not. It would still not
make it more useful than the

0c8fc6e0-8ce5-4743-919d-4d80b4bc39f1-2
00:23:33.306 --> 00:23:38.585
other type of usage approach
that I think if we want to go

0c8fc6e0-8ce5-4743-919d-4d80b4bc39f1-3
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:44.401
into the pipeline data, we want
to start searching right away as

0c8fc6e0-8ce5-4743-919d-4d80b4bc39f1-4
00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:46.460
opposed to viewing any.

8aa68996-9cab-41aa-88ce-76e9eab7a40e-0
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:47.730
Umm.

2eb2a39e-e1c3-42d2-9f73-527e3fbca377-0
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.351
You know, there, there could be
things up here that could be

2eb2a39e-e1c3-42d2-9f73-527e3fbca377-1
00:23:52.351 --> 00:23:55.543
useful, but right now, you know
part of it, it's our habit as

2eb2a39e-e1c3-42d2-9f73-527e3fbca377-2
00:23:55.543 --> 00:23:56.110
well, yeah.

4ca77df8-a248-40c9-b02d-f718fbd7aec8-0
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.270
Again, I think if there's some
sort of.

44f01c98-dd57-45c8-918c-2e9b0d65bdc1-0
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.956
Customization as one could do on
these things, then maybe it

44f01c98-dd57-45c8-918c-2e9b0d65bdc1-1
00:24:04.956 --> 00:24:06.260
could be more useful.

a30e78a4-1a68-452d-9a92-6499f7fa8e92-0
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.220
That's very good feedback. Thank
you. Um, the idea behind this is

a30e78a4-1a68-452d-9a92-6499f7fa8e92-1
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.105
also that you will, you should
be able to, you will be able to

a30e78a4-1a68-452d-9a92-6499f7fa8e92-2
00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:19.175
Click to click through these. So
for example if you click through

a30e78a4-1a68-452d-9a92-6499f7fa8e92-3
00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:22.813
phase two, this will then
transform into data that relates

a30e78a4-1a68-452d-9a92-6499f7fa8e92-4
00:24:22.813 --> 00:24:26.205
only to face two products that
we have in the evaluate

a30e78a4-1a68-452d-9a92-6499f7fa8e92-5
00:24:26.205 --> 00:24:26.760
universe.

8fc8815d-1f99-4734-82fc-937085ea2696-0
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.799
So the the kind of drilling that
I was talking about drilling

8fc8815d-1f99-4734-82fc-937085ea2696-1
00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:35.835
through the through the data
tomorrow to get more detail

8fc8815d-1f99-4734-82fc-937085ea2696-2
00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:40.366
analysis that's also that's also
how we want to, how we want to

8fc8815d-1f99-4734-82fc-937085ea2696-3
00:24:40.366 --> 00:24:44.543
build this. So you know maybe
would that be useful as well

8fc8815d-1f99-4734-82fc-937085ea2696-4
00:24:44.543 --> 00:24:47.800
maybe one thing you know the way
we use this.

e230aa02-1cd5-4e72-9e0a-d0540236078a-0
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.730
Is, I'll say complex query
driven.

fcff6a7c-9ec7-4681-b3f8-93e3643f479d-0
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.407
So we're not primarily using,
OK, I need to look at an

fcff6a7c-9ec7-4681-b3f8-93e3643f479d-1
00:24:57.407 --> 00:25:01.814
indication, I need to look at
the top ten competitor. You know

fcff6a7c-9ec7-4681-b3f8-93e3643f479d-2
00:25:01.814 --> 00:25:06.081
again we're not using it as
product managers. So, so most of

fcff6a7c-9ec7-4681-b3f8-93e3643f479d-3
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:07.830
what we're doing here is.

91604c32-58aa-404e-a6f7-bac87b141f09-0
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.530
Is um.

718a15d8-eb61-4cd4-b2fc-1d69f84e4a75-0
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.547
Finding a so phase two for
instance here click think

718a15d8-eb61-4cd4-b2fc-1d69f84e4a75-1
00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:19.620
clicking through a phase. We
wouldn't just care about phase

718a15d8-eb61-4cd4-b2fc-1d69f84e4a75-2
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.489
two in general, but we're
looking at you know, phase two

718a15d8-eb61-4cd4-b2fc-1d69f84e4a75-3
00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:27.290
that you know for a certain
technology subtype that you

718a15d8-eb61-4cd4-b2fc-1d69f84e4a75-4
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:27.630
know.

08d6febd-9981-4dfb-8cc2-c312bd247e07-0
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:34.107
You know maybe for you know if
if it's relevant for certain

08d6febd-9981-4dfb-8cc2-c312bd247e07-1
00:25:34.107 --> 00:25:38.942
route of administration you know
and that's and that's our

08d6febd-9981-4dfb-8cc2-c312bd247e07-2
00:25:38.942 --> 00:25:43.859
starting point you know and and
then you know maybe adding.

ec85c5f3-d382-4b9a-9f3d-1089789e69de-0
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.919
You know activity based sector
like market CAP or something

ec85c5f3-d382-4b9a-9f3d-1089789e69de-1
00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:54.454
else in which by the way we've
asked time and time again we'd

ec85c5f3-d382-4b9a-9f3d-1089789e69de-2
00:25:54.454 --> 00:25:58.916
love that to be a reportable
event and not just a filterable

ec85c5f3-d382-4b9a-9f3d-1089789e69de-3
00:25:58.916 --> 00:26:03.086
thing as those market cap
activities because we use that

ec85c5f3-d382-4b9a-9f3d-1089789e69de-4
00:26:03.086 --> 00:26:07.548
as a way to look at company
company sectors. But so we would

ec85c5f3-d382-4b9a-9f3d-1089789e69de-5
00:26:07.548 --> 00:26:12.010
develop a report like that and
that would be you know that's

ec85c5f3-d382-4b9a-9f3d-1089789e69de-6
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:16.179
the usage approach we normally
take is is complex query.

9f531dcc-9999-4635-a6c3-e4552166ff32-0
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.610
Urban, not unfiltered. Top down.

7aa608b1-b7fb-4ce5-9801-a52d0886568c-0
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.821
So we're looking at multiple
attributes and I I would say

7aa608b1-b7fb-4ce5-9801-a52d0886568c-1
00:26:24.821 --> 00:26:28.906
that you know, if we were going
to have an additional filter on

7aa608b1-b7fb-4ce5-9801-a52d0886568c-2
00:26:28.906 --> 00:26:32.544
the top which would make
everything smaller, it would be

7aa608b1-b7fb-4ce5-9801-a52d0886568c-3
00:26:32.544 --> 00:26:36.501
something like origin or you
know, technology here. Yeah, the

7aa608b1-b7fb-4ce5-9801-a52d0886568c-4
00:26:36.501 --> 00:26:40.585
technology, the, I'm sorry, the
technology, yeah. Is it selling

7aa608b1-b7fb-4ce5-9801-a52d0886568c-5
00:26:40.585 --> 00:26:43.330
gene therapy, is it small, small
molecule?

ed8ad032-c317-41ee-90cf-ffedb2d754f5-0
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:48.283
So it would be more if we were
going to filter on anything

ed8ad032-c317-41ee-90cf-ffedb2d754f5-1
00:26:48.283 --> 00:26:51.142
would more likely be that and
possibly route of

ed8ad032-c317-41ee-90cf-ffedb2d754f5-2
00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:54.893
administration. Mm-hmm. And I
understood I as I said I need to

ed8ad032-c317-41ee-90cf-ffedb2d754f5-3
00:26:54.893 --> 00:26:58.466
drop for another call. So Judith
carry that, carry the flag

ed8ad032-c317-41ee-90cf-ffedb2d754f5-4
00:26:58.466 --> 00:27:02.039
forward. Thanks. Thank you very
much. Very useful feedback.

0987655e-5505-471a-9ecc-5961fd53cfc4-0
00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:03.950
Bye, bye.

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-0
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.305
Um, so Judith, do you ever, if
you start your analysis and go

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-1
00:27:09.305 --> 00:27:13.724
to a specific page, for example,
do you ever edit or create your

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-2
00:27:13.724 --> 00:27:17.599
your reports? I know you
mentioned at the start that you

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-3
00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:21.678
rarely create a report from
scratch, but would you? No. No,

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-4
00:27:21.678 --> 00:27:25.893
I we create reports from scratch
all the time. But it depends

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-5
00:27:25.893 --> 00:27:29.769
where we Cornell likes to go in
by global analysis. He's

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-6
00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:34.188
extremely strategic oriented. I
tend to be doing a lot of odd ad

bac3bcdc-6456-49a2-a955-0ef3323b01e0-7
00:27:34.188 --> 00:27:34.800
hoc work.

64bbf52a-5d0d-40e7-bf1e-5616559e18bd-0
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.230
Or.

cdf44c31-e80f-4fd2-b13e-dfaef0d8804a-0
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.504
Helping with market landscaping
right. So I I may be doing

cdf44c31-e80f-4fd2-b13e-dfaef0d8804a-1
00:27:40.504 --> 00:27:45.216
things on a slightly narrower
focus So what what are what are

cdf44c31-e80f-4fd2-b13e-dfaef0d8804a-2
00:27:45.216 --> 00:27:49.776
the reported sales for selling
gene therapy and and and the

cdf44c31-e80f-4fd2-b13e-dfaef0d8804a-3
00:27:49.776 --> 00:27:50.460
specific?

1b16c040-8ece-4164-bddc-cafb5756b503-0
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:56.509
Aspects of selling gene therapy.
I've been using more and more

1b16c040-8ece-4164-bddc-cafb5756b503-1
00:27:56.509 --> 00:28:00.462
the the sub, the sub
technologies as well, and my

1b16c040-8ece-4164-bddc-cafb5756b503-2
00:28:00.462 --> 00:28:03.940
feelings on the sub technologies
are mixed.

5be60d8b-4977-4e92-8467-f7386fd657e5-0
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.052
They're not in a hierarchy, and
I kind of understand why,

5be60d8b-4977-4e92-8467-f7386fd657e5-1
00:28:09.052 --> 00:28:12.120
because they'd be in too many
hierarchies probably.

4fa43cb9-89f9-498d-963c-d77ef13b910a-0
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:17.084
Um, but it it there's a lot of
them. So I'm not sure what the

4fa43cb9-89f9-498d-963c-d77ef13b910a-1
00:28:17.084 --> 00:28:21.028
best way to deal with the sub
hierarchies are the the sub

4fa43cb9-89f9-498d-963c-d77ef13b910a-2
00:28:21.028 --> 00:28:25.311
technologies are, but it it's
it's good that you have that I I

4fa43cb9-89f9-498d-963c-d77ef13b910a-3
00:28:25.311 --> 00:28:29.322
have been using that more and
more as we're looking at the

4fa43cb9-89f9-498d-963c-d77ef13b910a-4
00:28:29.322 --> 00:28:33.333
cell and gene therapy in a
slightly more granular fashion.

4fa43cb9-89f9-498d-963c-d77ef13b910a-5
00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:37.548
It allows us to umm, I was able
to use the Omnium return data

4fa43cb9-89f9-498d-963c-d77ef13b910a-6
00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:37.820
for.

c86419dc-f7a4-4e4f-9f37-09d50df498f4-0
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.760
Allogeneic.

adaef800-f76b-49ce-846f-1c5390314658-0
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.120
Um, therapies.

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-0
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:50.525
OK. Well we we do have a
internal specialist who has been

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-1
00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:54.630
working on the on technology
subtypes. So we'll definitely

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-2
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.526
communicate your feedback to to
him and if there is any

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-3
00:28:58.526 --> 00:29:02.979
discussion that needs to happen
if you would be up for it he he

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-4
00:29:02.979 --> 00:29:07.154
will be more than happy to to
discuss it in detail as well.

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-5
00:29:07.154 --> 00:29:11.537
Unfortunately we're we're both
with Ankit we're not really the

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-6
00:29:11.537 --> 00:29:15.642
specialist in that area so I
wouldn't want to give you any

6ae752a5-279d-4e80-ad49-dcbebac152e2-7
00:29:15.642 --> 00:29:16.060
false.

791d34d2-4b3b-48fd-ab84-c0d3fdd4c024-0
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.090
Information in that subject.

ba532517-17fa-4e87-9e0d-1d5a3e7379db-0
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.610
If that's OK.

f2d72368-a8c2-49aa-a794-4103b21205d0-0
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.279
Could I just show you quickly
how we have changed the report

f2d72368-a8c2-49aa-a794-4103b21205d0-1
00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:32.199
building of yes, yes, yes, yes,
that's important. OK. So as I

f2d72368-a8c2-49aa-a794-4103b21205d0-2
00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:36.721
said, you have the embedded
report here and as you hover

f2d72368-a8c2-49aa-a794-4103b21205d0-3
00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:41.879
over the column titles, you can
see that the three dot menu pops

f2d72368-a8c2-49aa-a794-4103b21205d0-4
00:29:41.879 --> 00:29:42.990
up so you can.

aef3f943-f128-48d0-8d68-dca95ead9e4b-0
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:47.771
You can manipulate this report
further with columns that are

aef3f943-f128-48d0-8d68-dca95ead9e4b-1
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:51.965
already here. You can sort and
then you can filter on specific

aef3f943-f128-48d0-8d68-dca95ead9e4b-2
00:29:51.965 --> 00:29:56.092
things. You can also pin your
column to the left. So then now

aef3f943-f128-48d0-8d68-dca95ead9e4b-3
00:29:56.092 --> 00:30:00.020
we have the company column on
the left hand side and as we

aef3f943-f128-48d0-8d68-dca95ead9e4b-4
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:04.015
scroll to the right to see the
rest of the data you can see

aef3f943-f128-48d0-8d68-dca95ead9e4b-5
00:30:04.015 --> 00:30:05.280
what it relates to.

76a1587d-25d2-4a68-94e4-c116a3483521-0
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.963
Perfect. Yeah, that that drives
me. That's in platforms for

76a1587d-25d2-4a68-94e4-c116a3483521-1
00:30:09.963 --> 00:30:13.593
most. Most platforms don't do
that. And I I think that's very

76a1587d-25d2-4a68-94e4-c116a3483521-2
00:30:13.593 --> 00:30:17.400
important. We don't look at the
data a lot on the screen though.

ccb32f6b-5981-4979-8e5d-c607e21a19ac-0
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:22.518
Yes, we we, we look to see that
we're getting what we want and

ccb32f6b-5981-4979-8e5d-c607e21a19ac-1
00:30:22.518 --> 00:30:26.866
then we're exporting it because
we're often dealing with large

ccb32f6b-5981-4979-8e5d-c607e21a19ac-2
00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:31.076
datasets. So there are people
who might manipulate much here

ccb32f6b-5981-4979-8e5d-c607e21a19ac-3
00:30:31.076 --> 00:30:35.080
and sometimes I might do that,
but in general, pardon me.

7ede7023-14f8-48c0-892a-87dd3d241b4c-0
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.591
In general, I'm more likely to
make sure I have the columns in

7ede7023-14f8-48c0-892a-87dd3d241b4c-1
00:30:40.591 --> 00:30:44.504
the right order, scroll back and
forth to make sure everything's

7ede7023-14f8-48c0-892a-87dd3d241b4c-2
00:30:44.504 --> 00:30:48.356
the way I want it, and and then
export it. So I'm not going to.

7ede7023-14f8-48c0-892a-87dd3d241b4c-3
00:30:48.356 --> 00:30:52.268
I may do some filtering just to
see if the data is what I expect

7ede7023-14f8-48c0-892a-87dd3d241b4c-4
00:30:52.268 --> 00:30:52.809
it to be.

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-0
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.440
Yes, I may do some filtering or
sorting to see if the data is

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-1
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.200
what I expect. Yeah, yeah that's
that makes sense. There is an

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-2
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.020
option to export your report in
CSV or Excel file and then also

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-3
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.840
that little icon gives you the
ability to save your reports. So

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-4
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.421
then you can access it through
here or on that landing page

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-5
00:31:12.421 --> 00:31:16.062
when I showed you. So we can
just pick up where you left off

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-6
00:31:16.062 --> 00:31:19.763
last time. Let me just show you
how to manipulate your report

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-7
00:31:19.763 --> 00:31:23.523
further so as you can you click
through the manage columns you

7c984768-7381-4842-a27e-0962fa8b457a-8
00:31:23.523 --> 00:31:24.240
are able to.

6a35784b-de66-4f8a-92b1-b48a356da763-0
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.727
Add to your report. This is the,
UM, the fault that we have on

6a35784b-de66-4f8a-92b1-b48a356da763-1
00:31:28.727 --> 00:31:33.205
the site on that page currently.
You are able to then drop down

6a35784b-de66-4f8a-92b1-b48a356da763-2
00:31:33.205 --> 00:31:37.472
your options here so you have
the classification fields that

6a35784b-de66-4f8a-92b1-b48a356da763-3
00:31:37.472 --> 00:31:41.600
you can drill into. You can
select all of them at once you

6a35784b-de66-4f8a-92b1-b48a356da763-4
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.650
can search for.

6cef1b87-6878-40ec-882d-ccb54aa838d3-0
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.806
Indications you can search for
the for the specific column if

6cef1b87-6878-40ec-882d-ccb54aa838d3-1
00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:51.430
you know the name, if not then
they are.

b07a399a-2fbd-4ede-972b-7a541de24c47-0
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.795
What are grouped by by specific
folders? Sorry, what's the?

b07a399a-2fbd-4ede-972b-7a541de24c47-1
00:31:56.795 --> 00:32:00.250
What's the difference between
the search ohh search for the

b07a399a-2fbd-4ede-972b-7a541de24c47-2
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.706
columns at? And? What's the
search other search bar? What's

b07a399a-2fbd-4ede-972b-7a541de24c47-3
00:32:03.706 --> 00:32:06.239
the difference between the two
search bars?

306fd336-ca99-4279-a422-8e055f95a3a4-0
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.682
I don't believe there is one.
OK, that's confusing just on

306fd336-ca99-4279-a422-8e055f95a3a4-1
00:32:10.682 --> 00:32:14.091
that one. So sorry ma'am, if you
just press the little cross on

306fd336-ca99-4279-a422-8e055f95a3a4-2
00:32:14.091 --> 00:32:17.500
that search, but you're on, so
you could see different entities

306fd336-ca99-4279-a422-8e055f95a3a4-3
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.110
there. You've got a drug company
and indication.

27c859b4-6d73-4f5c-9eb3-108b9cc23f07-0
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.750
Um, yeah, just press that. Click
in.

f9bc0b48-11ad-44e5-9ad3-73c77ebf814b-0
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.506
Hmm, so if you use the top
search bar, it searches across

f9bc0b48-11ad-44e5-9ad3-73c77ebf814b-1
00:32:27.506 --> 00:32:28.740
all three entities?

db6ae6a5-b18e-437a-8600-56cc483a034f-0
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.291
And then you've also got a
search bar within each entity.

db6ae6a5-b18e-437a-8600-56cc483a034f-1
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:35.300
So if you just want to search
within drugs, you can do that.

db6ae6a5-b18e-437a-8600-56cc483a034f-2
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.112
If you want to just search
across, then you can just use

db6ae6a5-b18e-437a-8600-56cc483a034f-3
00:32:38.112 --> 00:32:41.170
the top search bar. Oh, OK, you
need to make that more clear.

db6ae6a5-b18e-437a-8600-56cc483a034f-4
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:41.959
Yes. Understood.

6fe90f3a-1429-45e6-8a9d-2df573935888-0
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.695
Ohh, so, umm, we have selected
indications, so that was, um,

6fe90f3a-1429-45e6-8a9d-2df573935888-1
00:32:47.695 --> 00:32:51.654
indications summary. So that was
added at the bottom here as you

6fe90f3a-1429-45e6-8a9d-2df573935888-2
00:32:51.654 --> 00:32:55.248
can see today. So now we have
that little hand that we can

6fe90f3a-1429-45e6-8a9d-2df573935888-3
00:32:55.248 --> 00:32:59.085
just drag and drop and change
the order of columns as you wish

6fe90f3a-1429-45e6-8a9d-2df573935888-4
00:32:59.085 --> 00:33:01.400
on the right side indication
summary.

dc864102-bc7a-45ce-982a-c5f5524f5a10-0
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:08.260
Indication summary the IT just
says indications how where the.

809d2e50-dc95-4eb8-ade1-15b67f277f21-0
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.040
Oh OK, indication summary OK,
because it's a specific folder

809d2e50-dc95-4eb8-ade1-15b67f277f21-1
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.893
and in the brackets it tells you
how many specific fields you

809d2e50-dc95-4eb8-ade1-15b67f277f21-2
00:33:17.893 --> 00:33:20.130
have in that category, for
example.

0a2afb80-792e-40e7-9b69-f21dc6838a3e-0
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:25.047
OK, so right. And then we can
delete columns as well if you

0a2afb80-792e-40e7-9b69-f21dc6838a3e-1
00:33:25.047 --> 00:33:28.970
don't, if we don't need them. So
let's move a little bit.

2fdb3a24-7954-4aba-aa5e-65059979a95a-0
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:34.245
Um, some of them out. And then,
yeah, the drag and drop, you can

2fdb3a24-7954-4aba-aa5e-65059979a95a-1
00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:38.610
see where it's going to end up
and as we click apply changes,

2fdb3a24-7954-4aba-aa5e-65059979a95a-2
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.300
all of that is going to.

e948670b-b1d4-4bac-9744-eedf00f81088-0
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.410
Be applied here you can see.

a612ac15-2d5a-4f05-b245-ad16784081b6-0
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.260
Your data is in that right order
now.

bd3e6d5c-3072-4a69-acc4-7d7e67f1f07d-0
00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.560
We haven't added any sales data
here, so let me just.

12133165-4f2b-40f9-9145-a9f698766494-0
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.590
Let me just add a couple um
dates.

693b8836-67fe-401d-be7e-48a06d9739cc-0
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.668
I just want to quickly show you
the differences in terms of the

693b8836-67fe-401d-be7e-48a06d9739cc-1
00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:08.770
filtering ability for different
field types, so bear with.

ee4ba426-4f72-4145-881c-7c3a1308fcaa-0
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.250
Peak sales should do OK.

1191f5d2-4a7a-42f8-a7a2-3a228cda1fb5-0
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.994
So so this integrates all the
the platform information in

1191f5d2-4a7a-42f8-a7a2-3a228cda1fb5-1
00:34:17.994 --> 00:34:18.320
here.

520b463c-2c77-4941-a71a-09fb163f2fc4-0
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.445
Yes. Well, not that, not yet,
but will because yeah, as I

520b463c-2c77-4941-a71a-09fb163f2fc4-1
00:34:22.445 --> 00:34:25.657
said, you know some of the data
is not there yet, but yes, we

520b463c-2c77-4941-a71a-09fb163f2fc4-2
00:34:25.657 --> 00:34:27.160
will be migrating everything.

4e4adb05-6bc6-4726-92da-6e73eb94020f-0
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.050
OK. So we have added, uh, what
we have added, so we've added

4e4adb05-6bc6-4726-92da-6e73eb94020f-1
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.700
the sales data, so you can see
now.

f5b9fefd-9ccf-40f3-9b2f-d391fc16e13c-0
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.571
Ohh that's big sales. So that
would be at the filter. So these

f5b9fefd-9ccf-40f3-9b2f-d391fc16e13c-1
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:46.303
filters, they work more or less
like like they would in Excel.

f5b9fefd-9ccf-40f3-9b2f-d391fc16e13c-2
00:34:46.303 --> 00:34:47.729
So you can you can.

5d37a98c-d5fa-4ecc-a461-9ba69659f122-0
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.875
Excuse me, you can filter on
specific ranges between less

5d37a98c-d5fa-4ecc-a461-9ba69659f122-1
00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:57.779
equal to um and then you can you
can select your ranges here you

5d37a98c-d5fa-4ecc-a461-9ba69659f122-2
00:34:57.779 --> 00:35:02.230
can sort with descending or
ascending as well. So so these

5d37a98c-d5fa-4ecc-a461-9ba69659f122-3
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.756
are the options that we have
added to make it more editable

5d37a98c-d5fa-4ecc-a461-9ba69659f122-4
00:35:06.756 --> 00:35:09.020
before you export to XLS well.

5113e09a-f33b-4422-bb88-e97165d70394-0
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.290
And I don't think we've got a.

ef911a21-5b63-4b00-9a47-9921f95ad419-0
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.316
A date field? But what do you
think, Judith? Is that

ef911a21-5b63-4b00-9a47-9921f95ad419-1
00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:21.221
something? It looks good. It
looks a little more, uh, a

ef911a21-5b63-4b00-9a47-9921f95ad419-2
00:35:21.221 --> 00:35:25.754
little easier to use as opposed
to having to press the arrow and

ef911a21-5b63-4b00-9a47-9921f95ad419-3
00:35:25.754 --> 00:35:26.870
sending it back.

ab554b5c-f9f8-4a0d-a020-bd3b0616422c-0
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.917
Right. Which is, you know, a
little early 2000s called. It

ab554b5c-f9f8-4a0d-a020-bd3b0616422c-1
00:35:32.917 --> 00:35:35.060
wants its interface back. Um.

2fa6def5-f892-459a-b48b-619c3be47567-0
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:36.840


a7654dfe-6fcf-4dc6-8d52-9c6217e15e60-0
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:42.135
I I think, you know, I'd have to
play with it more. But I think

a7654dfe-6fcf-4dc6-8d52-9c6217e15e60-1
00:35:42.135 --> 00:35:45.721
it, I think it works. Uh, drugs
company. It may be a little

a7654dfe-6fcf-4dc6-8d52-9c6217e15e60-2
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:49.546
clearer than all the different
segments now, but I have to, I'd

a7654dfe-6fcf-4dc6-8d52-9c6217e15e60-3
00:35:49.546 --> 00:35:53.192
have to, I'll I'll take some
time to go through it and look.

a7654dfe-6fcf-4dc6-8d52-9c6217e15e60-4
00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:53.789
Pardon me.

ec1197cf-06db-420b-9d10-0510c7378d59-0
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.720
Hey, hold up before the alarm
today. That's never good.

4f0e0600-ffef-451a-aa2c-cce69554feaa-0
00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.760
Wow, how did that happen? I am
not sure.

ed67a7f5-c10a-4cd0-b2a2-fe34e8ba944c-0
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:08.086
Never happens to me. It does not
usually happen. And then I'm

ed67a7f5-c10a-4cd0-b2a2-fe34e8ba944c-1
00:36:08.086 --> 00:36:12.103
sitting there going, well, is
it? My husband covers the clock

ed67a7f5-c10a-4cd0-b2a2-fe34e8ba944c-2
00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:16.119
and I had turned my phone off.
I'm like, OK, it's 5:50, is it

ed67a7f5-c10a-4cd0-b2a2-fe34e8ba944c-3
00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:20.136
5:00 o'clock in the morning.
What time is it? Do I get up? Do

ed67a7f5-c10a-4cd0-b2a2-fe34e8ba944c-4
00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:20.590
I know?

be2dbe00-baef-44cb-92e2-01b88c598d51-0
00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:26.370
Ohh, so it would be good to go
through these and and I'll.

b62e2658-df5b-4571-9c0f-22a80d22e1f4-0
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:31.553
Look at everything and and see
if I and one thing, one feedback

b62e2658-df5b-4571-9c0f-22a80d22e1f4-1
00:36:31.553 --> 00:36:33.930
that I would like to to make is
that.

805ec23a-5d28-4f0e-8b49-7f54393d7378-0
00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.378
Most people learn this kind of
by trial and error, and that is

805ec23a-5d28-4f0e-8b49-7f54393d7378-1
00:36:39.378 --> 00:36:40.510
when you have the.

eac069de-930a-4bba-a023-a5497bc809e3-0
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.520
Indication based information
versus the worldwide.

5369c071-12c4-4d44-ba4f-014c157e381c-0
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:50.097
Indication sales indication
based sales, I I think there

5369c071-12c4-4d44-ba4f-014c157e381c-1
00:36:50.097 --> 00:36:54.810
needs to be a way to clarify
what that does to your report.

e3825f3b-0c39-42a4-89bf-f33aa84b8975-0
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.330
OK. Yeah. And what you're
looking at because?

63cb3ac2-414e-4034-a7d8-4df443580d81-0
00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.900
It can get confusing.

68b7ebde-a4ad-47bf-8695-b161bf50e954-0
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:12.080
He can get confusing. Um,
regarding um.

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-0
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.155
Yeah, train of thought is not
doing too well today. It can't

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-1
00:37:18.155 --> 00:37:21.977
get confusing as to what you're
looking at because you have

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-2
00:37:21.977 --> 00:37:25.735
repeating rows, you know, and
things like that, and that's

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-3
00:37:25.735 --> 00:37:29.811
regardless of what an interface
that's going to be on. So these

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-4
00:37:29.811 --> 00:37:33.570
are things that I think there
could be a little pop-ups or

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-5
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.519
something explaining it or or
something. I I think that there

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-6
00:37:37.519 --> 00:37:41.341
are some mapping issues. You
know I I I I'm the bug Finder.

13eb4a01-da02-4a6b-acd0-aaea5d0cab0d-7
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:44.080
I, I find all the little bugs
and all the.

a30bfbcf-f6dd-4a81-8983-77b89e4bc697-0
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:49.223
Interfaces all the time. And so
I I a couple of years ago, when

a30bfbcf-f6dd-4a81-8983-77b89e4bc697-1
00:37:49.223 --> 00:37:52.770
I first started, I was working
with Griffin.

2ca18622-35ed-431e-b0af-91ded28567bf-0
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:58.118
Siegel, yes, he was our account
tech support and we were trying

2ca18622-35ed-431e-b0af-91ded28567bf-1
00:37:58.118 --> 00:38:02.471
to create these very complex
reports for this person in tech

2ca18622-35ed-431e-b0af-91ded28567bf-2
00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:06.754
in operations and we were having
problems. Some fields just

2ca18622-35ed-431e-b0af-91ded28567bf-3
00:38:06.754 --> 00:38:10.680
weren't mapping right and this
would not be that, but.

c0566006-593e-4cfd-b905-49747ccd9dfb-0
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.706
When people are doing
indications and worldwide sales,

c0566006-593e-4cfd-b905-49747ccd9dfb-1
00:38:14.706 --> 00:38:18.082
they they need to understand
what they're looking at and I

c0566006-593e-4cfd-b905-49747ccd9dfb-2
00:38:18.082 --> 00:38:19.570
think that needs to be on.

8d925980-9883-4b3e-9185-20b9deebd6ac-0
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.010
Somehow.

64b719c1-e7cf-49d7-840a-0ae9b02b4fa1-0
00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.480
Alerted to somehow on the
screen. I'm not sure how one

64b719c1-e7cf-49d7-840a-0ae9b02b4fa1-1
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.972
would do that, but I know that
that causes confusion. Same with

64b719c1-e7cf-49d7-840a-0ae9b02b4fa1-2
00:38:29.972 --> 00:38:32.210
the orphan drug status, the
orphan drug.

3c89b78b-c581-47e0-ac97-086d1c1a948d-0
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.060
Uh, not status but um.

eba4c387-6b5a-4503-ab0c-89316d3e3b91-0
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.830
But when a country.

703eacca-626e-4f62-99c7-58bb1cce4268-0
00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.070
Approved orphan drug status.

060f4973-6006-42bb-8715-f07eb5bb3910-0
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:49.023
And you're putting if you just
have a drug versus the

060f4973-6006-42bb-8715-f07eb5bb3910-1
00:38:49.023 --> 00:38:53.583
indication, drug indication
pair, the ACID indication pair

060f4973-6006-42bb-8715-f07eb5bb3910-2
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:58.452
because the the orphan status is
by indication not by drug and

060f4973-6006-42bb-8715-f07eb5bb3910-3
00:38:58.452 --> 00:39:02.780
that gets people confused as
well. So the, the, the the

060f4973-6006-42bb-8715-f07eb5bb3910-4
00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:06.799
orphan status is for that asset
at that indication.

228231f4-b48d-4ee6-8890-40fdf971f171-0
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.326
Only so these are things that
could be clarified somehow.

228231f4-b48d-4ee6-8890-40fdf971f171-1
00:39:11.326 --> 00:39:15.047
We'll take that back to the
team. Thank you. This is really

228231f4-b48d-4ee6-8890-40fdf971f171-2
00:39:15.047 --> 00:39:16.040
useful feedback.

722e0bbd-80e2-4e07-913e-447079bb3e7c-0
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:17.760
Umm.

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-0
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.820
Can I just ohh I've got the UM
date field here so just wanted

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-1
00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.560
to show you what the filtering
options are here so you can

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-2
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.680
filter on a specific date range.
So you can filter from and then

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-3
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.483
it gives you the the the entire
view from whatever date you

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-4
00:39:34.483 --> 00:39:37.653
choose you can choose. This
becomes. This becomes

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-5
00:39:37.653 --> 00:39:41.646
problematic when you put just a
column for patent data without

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-6
00:39:41.646 --> 00:39:45.386
any context for what patent
we're looking at. What kind of

e0f3741f-9831-4741-995c-b98f20016e78-7
00:39:45.386 --> 00:39:48.999
patent is this? Is this a
formulation? Is this the? The?

3a6dd900-884e-4cde-9b1c-94b9e6b18f57-0
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:53.208
You know, is this a loss of
exclusivity patent? What? What

3a6dd900-884e-4cde-9b1c-94b9e6b18f57-1
00:39:53.208 --> 00:39:57.458
are we looking at? So this can
be dangerous because you can get

3a6dd900-884e-4cde-9b1c-94b9e6b18f57-2
00:39:57.458 --> 00:40:01.310
wrong or misleading information
without knowing what this

3a6dd900-884e-4cde-9b1c-94b9e6b18f57-3
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.228
patent, what this patent column
actually means. OK, patent

3a6dd900-884e-4cde-9b1c-94b9e6b18f57-4
00:40:05.228 --> 00:40:08.349
expiry, but there's multiple
patents per drug.

6f3624d9-80ca-4542-bcf0-f53dfd0f4139-0
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.210
What are we looking at here?

82479867-99a8-4b5c-b516-54fdb2847809-0
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.729
Right. What the explanation? I
think you know what we have at

82479867-99a8-4b5c-b516-54fdb2847809-1
00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:19.241
the moment. When you click
through the column title, it

82479867-99a8-4b5c-b516-54fdb2847809-2
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:23.005
gives you the definition. Would
that help? Would that help?

82479867-99a8-4b5c-b516-54fdb2847809-3
00:40:23.005 --> 00:40:26.580
Yeah, it also have yeah, you
cannot get rid of the Cheat

82479867-99a8-4b5c-b516-54fdb2847809-4
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.020
Sheets.

a54777e2-ce01-4c6e-9659-eb7e9086c8d9-0
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:33.920
I gotcha. You gotta have the
definitions, yeah, because.

6bef1a60-8ba1-42f5-b194-522bd3165586-0
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.650
They are very helpful,
especially when you're doing.

d2c90f97-dcd0-4771-a68c-f82f5dce1045-0
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.324
Modeling or you're doing
anything else where you need to

d2c90f97-dcd0-4771-a68c-f82f5dce1045-1
00:40:43.324 --> 00:40:47.981
understand the scope of the
field the the actual definition

d2c90f97-dcd0-4771-a68c-f82f5dce1045-2
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:48.990
of the field.

36d31aa3-c2a6-475e-9d92-47cbd6dfba3a-0
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.350
Having it.

a618e015-1ef1-45a7-b23e-d53f80b9936e-0
00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.790
Easy for him. I'm trying to
remember now.

2cf4171f-29a4-46d6-97df-dd7dab41f8a2-0
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.737
I haven't gotten into evaluate.
I was going into evaluate a lot

2cf4171f-29a4-46d6-97df-dd7dab41f8a2-1
00:40:58.737 --> 00:41:01.460
more last few months. I have not
been going into it.

88dfece8-b627-48b3-bf57-14c695178470-0
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:07.138
Except in the I've been going
into Omnia more than anything

88dfece8-b627-48b3-bf57-14c695178470-1
00:41:07.138 --> 00:41:08.160
else. So I I um.

2b6e0882-1c49-40b6-ba1a-9076d03d2e50-0
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:10.160
Uh.

8e64a6be-1e49-4d27-bb61-65e2e3424192-0
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.050
The the You know an easy way to
either get to the definitions.

4e9891f7-ad64-4f29-8e07-e7210881bacf-0
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:22.504
Uh, whether it's a help button
or click on the uh, the, the

4e9891f7-ad64-4f29-8e07-e7210881bacf-1
00:41:22.504 --> 00:41:25.720
heading, whatever works, but
there has to be.

82e1d49a-c3df-4fe0-afab-1e17f291754f-0
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.181
A easy way of looking at the
definition for the field. OK,

82e1d49a-c3df-4fe0-afab-1e17f291754f-1
00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:32.830
that's really helpful.

8ef86a80-db41-4ec8-8681-cd6633ba0a9a-0
00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:37.292
Um, OK. I think this is
everything that I wanted to show

8ef86a80-db41-4ec8-8681-cd6633ba0a9a-1
00:41:37.292 --> 00:41:41.070
you today in terms of the new
platform, what do you think

8ef86a80-db41-4ec8-8681-cd6633ba0a9a-2
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.044
about the report builder, the
the functionality? I'm I'm not

8ef86a80-db41-4ec8-8681-cd6633ba0a9a-3
00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:45.369
sure.

d243b410-5498-4216-be0b-e424b6a51490-0
00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.810
And I think it's it's basically
good. Uh.

1339e539-370c-4140-bdcb-b4d646e69d3a-0
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.410
I I want to play with.

87412dc8-5d4f-4879-8021-61b33e0e399c-0
00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.416
Yes, I'll have to play with it
to get a sense of how easy is it

87412dc8-5d4f-4879-8021-61b33e0e399c-1
00:41:58.416 --> 00:42:00.784
to find the different
attributes, the different

87412dc8-5d4f-4879-8021-61b33e0e399c-2
00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:01.130
fields.

c9ab9118-6d20-478b-b508-a375c9365669-0
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.594
Umm, I think I like the fact
that you have them maybe grouped

c9ab9118-6d20-478b-b508-a375c9365669-1
00:42:06.594 --> 00:42:11.001
in a better way. The other way
was a little confusing, so I

c9ab9118-6d20-478b-b508-a375c9365669-2
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:15.189
think there are so many
sections. That was the part that

c9ab9118-6d20-478b-b508-a375c9365669-3
00:42:15.189 --> 00:42:19.816
was a little problematic. Your
eyes would start to cross after

c9ab9118-6d20-478b-b508-a375c9365669-4
00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:24.518
a while. There's so much data in
this database, so if there's a

c9ab9118-6d20-478b-b508-a375c9365669-5
00:42:24.518 --> 00:42:27.529
easier way to corral it into
categories.

dcc7bb35-f848-466c-bdd9-7a6fd70b6a44-0
00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.050
I will look for that when I test
it.

20b3cd92-d2ce-455d-869c-b13635c68584-0
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.863
Right, because it would be,
yeah, sorry, go on. No, no,

20b3cd92-d2ce-455d-869c-b13635c68584-1
00:42:34.863 --> 00:42:37.555
that's. So that would be an
important thing. If that has

20b3cd92-d2ce-455d-869c-b13635c68584-2
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:40.482
made that a little more obvious
or clear where all the fields

20b3cd92-d2ce-455d-869c-b13635c68584-3
00:42:40.482 --> 00:42:41.710
are, that would be useful.

444cb8b0-a416-437e-b792-252f5aaf65e3-0
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.584
OK, perfect. Well, thank you
very much. That would be really

444cb8b0-a416-437e-b792-252f5aaf65e3-1
00:42:45.584 --> 00:42:48.585
helpful, Judith, if you could go
in yourself and have a have a

444cb8b0-a416-437e-b792-252f5aaf65e3-2
00:42:48.585 --> 00:42:51.394
walk around, see what you've
been kind of meaning to for a

444cb8b0-a416-437e-b792-252f5aaf65e3-3
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:52.490
while, but I never did.

f4861fea-bd89-4e90-b203-b45a822c6d44-0
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.759
Whenever, whenever you've got
time. We're always, we're

f4861fea-bd89-4e90-b203-b45a822c6d44-1
00:42:56.759 --> 00:43:00.035
always, uh, we always welcome
feedback, but that's everything

f4861fea-bd89-4e90-b203-b45a822c6d44-2
00:43:00.035 --> 00:43:03.205
from me. Thank you very much.
I'm Keith. Over to you. Thank

f4861fea-bd89-4e90-b203-b45a822c6d44-3
00:43:03.205 --> 00:43:06.376
you very much. Judith. I'm
conscious that we're a couple of

f4861fea-bd89-4e90-b203-b45a822c6d44-4
00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:08.490
minutes over. Are you OK for
time? Yes.

204de86a-6ef8-4c15-94c6-462c974e4f70-0
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.813
OK, cool. So it won't be long.
Um, I just wanted to ask you a

204de86a-6ef8-4c15-94c6-462c974e4f70-1
00:43:12.813 --> 00:43:15.861
quick question about
visualizations actually. So on

204de86a-6ef8-4c15-94c6-462c974e4f70-2
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:19.378
the index page that you see in
when magma clicked on browse

204de86a-6ef8-4c15-94c6-462c974e4f70-3
00:43:19.378 --> 00:43:22.895
data and then you've got your
metrics and then you add your

204de86a-6ef8-4c15-94c6-462c974e4f70-4
00:43:22.895 --> 00:43:26.411
events top three therapeutic
categories. We're also looking

204de86a-6ef8-4c15-94c6-462c974e4f70-5
00:43:26.411 --> 00:43:29.576
to put some charting and
visualizations on that. It's

204de86a-6ef8-4c15-94c6-462c974e4f70-6
00:43:29.576 --> 00:43:30.280
just to get.

1eb13a99-8e03-4b03-aed1-1255599a5398-0
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:35.907
Initial thoughts on what kind of
charting would be beneficial for

1eb13a99-8e03-4b03-aed1-1255599a5398-1
00:43:35.907 --> 00:43:40.508
you? Do you? Did you often use
characterization on that page?

1eb13a99-8e03-4b03-aed1-1255599a5398-2
00:43:40.508 --> 00:43:44.515
Would only be useful if the
dashboard was immediately

1eb13a99-8e03-4b03-aed1-1255599a5398-3
00:43:44.515 --> 00:43:49.190
filterable by attributes that
are useful to us. So the page as

1eb13a99-8e03-4b03-aed1-1255599a5398-4
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:54.013
it stands now would not serve us
serve a lot of purpose to us at

1eb13a99-8e03-4b03-aed1-1255599a5398-5
00:43:54.013 --> 00:43:55.720
all in any in any form.

acc365fd-e977-4078-8df1-1b10f37ce97a-0
00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:01.096
Uh, in terms of data, especially
in terms of data visualization,

acc365fd-e977-4078-8df1-1b10f37ce97a-1
00:44:01.096 --> 00:44:04.649
as I mentioned earlier, I think
we're probably more interested

acc365fd-e977-4078-8df1-1b10f37ce97a-2
00:44:04.649 --> 00:44:07.469
in the data visualization after
we run the query.

5462d4eb-704e-4d68-aac8-40734a05efa1-0
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:14.381
So if these charts could be
filterable or queryable in some

5462d4eb-704e-4d68-aac8-40734a05efa1-1
00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:16.500
way and then adapted.

9b6c7148-868b-441e-8f4f-948687ca37df-0
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:18.760
Uh.

254736d2-3cf4-44de-af24-2fb8ef36e685-0
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:21.950
Changed.

ce434550-9f78-47df-80a1-9f7d6ca83ccd-0
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.770
That could be useful.

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-0
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.992
OK, yeah, I'm just showing an
example here. So this is this is

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-1
00:44:29.992 --> 00:44:33.504
this is not um yet your website.
This is just a prototype. But

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-2
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:36.849
yeah you can see a bar chart
there. And I guess once you've

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-3
00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:40.305
applied your filters here at the
bottom table your calculated

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-4
00:44:40.305 --> 00:44:43.371
metrics at the top would adjust
and then so would your

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-5
00:44:43.371 --> 00:44:46.883
visualization. So would there be
a don't want we don't want to

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-6
00:44:46.883 --> 00:44:50.284
get to the if you're gonna put a
lot of stuff on the top, we

573cec59-b188-434d-9457-1743ca5fc803-7
00:44:50.284 --> 00:44:52.960
wanna, we will often want to
create the report.

c84b03b9-5890-450d-a308-ef0286735586-0
00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.040
So OK, we don't want to Scroll
down a lot, so.

75e58779-9494-447f-87bb-b46d354b8d54-0
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.230
That's where I think we're
having a a view.

eb7c74b4-e901-4e53-bed6-122843551d9a-0
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.290
How to view this?

0b83e4cd-82fe-4e34-826b-1f5bac25505c-0
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.070
Module differently.

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-0
00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.396
Other people might want to see
that, but we would want the

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-1
00:45:12.396 --> 00:45:16.108
option of maybe a little close,
close, close, close, close and

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-2
00:45:16.108 --> 00:45:19.702
set or setting so we don't see
any of this. Other people may

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-3
00:45:19.702 --> 00:45:23.414
like it. So if we could have an
option, we don't see all of it

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-4
00:45:23.414 --> 00:45:27.302
and then we can just immediately
start doing our search or keep a

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-5
00:45:27.302 --> 00:45:30.896
couple things up there that
would be useful for us if we can

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-6
00:45:30.896 --> 00:45:34.785
customize it, and that way if we
could customize that so we don't

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-7
00:45:34.785 --> 00:45:38.202
Scroll down, you know, two
screens before we get to where

5605726d-7f5a-48b7-bdb9-9c8d350f9e5e-8
00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.440
we can do our search.

05e79b8c-fd67-45f7-a420-0d85417a26fb-0
00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.266
So I think, I think the idea of
being able to those sections

05e79b8c-fd67-45f7-a420-0d85417a26fb-1
00:45:45.266 --> 00:45:49.542
collapse that that was the word
I was looking for. Thank you.

05e79b8c-fd67-45f7-a420-0d85417a26fb-2
00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:52.370
Collapse or uncollapsed those
different.

a63b2574-7f01-4088-b38f-f9fd07f40edf-0
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.783
The different data
visualizations and then set that

a63b2574-7f01-4088-b38f-f9fd07f40edf-1
00:45:57.783 --> 00:46:00.320
as a setting. For us that would
be.

bb5d858b-1876-43f9-bb0d-ec610fb836bc-0
00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.848
Great, because obviously we're
not your biggest use case, um,

bb5d858b-1876-43f9-bb0d-ec610fb836bc-1
00:46:05.848 --> 00:46:10.173
compared to someone, but there
could very well be someone who's

bb5d858b-1876-43f9-bb0d-ec610fb836bc-2
00:46:10.173 --> 00:46:12.200
only works in neuro Neurology.

e716b2cc-357f-4b5e-b921-c3db15e383f0-0
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:14.860
And they're focused on.

4d8cc755-895a-4614-8e0b-96ab20aefe73-0
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.796
Maybe one or two mechanisms of
action. Well, they could

4d8cc755-895a-4614-8e0b-96ab20aefe73-1
00:46:18.796 --> 00:46:22.065
customize their dashboard for
that, and they maybe want to see

4d8cc755-895a-4614-8e0b-96ab20aefe73-2
00:46:22.065 --> 00:46:25.231
all the visualizations, but
that's what we call a sliver and

4d8cc755-895a-4614-8e0b-96ab20aefe73-3
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:27.099
Long Island, we call that a
sliver.

a42f5442-78f2-4b6f-b3a3-a04aac94aa6b-0
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.426
I am, uh, I'm a sliver of data.
Most of my family lives on data.

a42f5442-78f2-4b6f-b3a3-a04aac94aa6b-1
00:46:33.426 --> 00:46:37.902
Yeah, well, we tend to call them
slices. Yes, yes, yes. There's

a42f5442-78f2-4b6f-b3a3-a04aac94aa6b-2
00:46:37.902 --> 00:46:42.168
maybe it's English slices of
bread sandwiches. I don't know.

a42f5442-78f2-4b6f-b3a3-a04aac94aa6b-3
00:46:42.168 --> 00:46:45.875
Maybe. No, it's it's it's it's
my Long Island Jewish

a42f5442-78f2-4b6f-b3a3-a04aac94aa6b-4
00:46:45.875 --> 00:46:50.421
background. You guys, I'm gonna
cut you a sliver. I'm on a diet.

a42f5442-78f2-4b6f-b3a3-a04aac94aa6b-5
00:46:50.421 --> 00:46:52.310
I'm gonna cut you a sliver.

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-0
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.813
I have had 10 before as well.
Actually. I think that's what my

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-1
00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:59.955
aunt is. Aunties and uncles say,
you know, slither of cake. Um,

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-2
00:46:59.955 --> 00:47:02.901
cool. I am conscious that we
have gone 5 minutes over. That

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-3
00:47:02.901 --> 00:47:05.994
was the only thing I wanted to
ask. Um, actually that's a like

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-4
00:47:05.994 --> 00:47:08.989
final question. Do you ever use
our data on the go or do you

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-5
00:47:08.989 --> 00:47:11.689
ever use anyone else's data on
the go, IE on a remote?

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-6
00:47:11.689 --> 00:47:14.733
Absolutely probably not because
I don't know what you mean by

19be2e3d-4cee-48d1-a20b-58c0b3384eef-7
00:47:14.733 --> 00:47:15.470
data on the go.

9ee3ca22-f762-4479-a9c1-25bcbec36fba-0
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:20.475
OK, apologies. So would you ever
act so data sources just such as

9ee3ca22-f762-4479-a9c1-25bcbec36fba-1
00:47:20.475 --> 00:47:24.361
evaluate and whichever other
sort of data providers you use,

9ee3ca22-f762-4479-a9c1-25bcbec36fba-2
00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:28.247
would you ever log into their
dashboards and their platforms

9ee3ca22-f762-4479-a9c1-25bcbec36fba-3
00:47:28.247 --> 00:47:32.070
on any other device such as a
mobile or a tablet or is it a

9ee3ca22-f762-4479-a9c1-25bcbec36fba-4
00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:35.319
laptop or a desktop is
predominantly what you use?

ad579266-daac-4a27-b6f9-3a03b6d2213a-0
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.536
Don't travel much at all. Uh,
we're actually for the past two

ad579266-daac-4a27-b6f9-3a03b6d2213a-1
00:47:40.536 --> 00:47:44.475
years I haven't gone anywhere
much at all except for an annual

ad579266-daac-4a27-b6f9-3a03b6d2213a-2
00:47:44.475 --> 00:47:48.414
vacation. So it's really sad.
But that being beside the point,

ad579266-daac-4a27-b6f9-3a03b6d2213a-3
00:47:48.414 --> 00:47:52.353
I would never want to attempt to
do what I need to do on these

ad579266-daac-4a27-b6f9-3a03b6d2213a-4
00:47:52.353 --> 00:47:55.230
platforms on a phone. And I have
a big phone.

1446a4c0-1d78-4423-90ed-a258cfdf3d03-0
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:01.440
No worries, that's fine. It's a
big phone.

4300836a-69d9-4ee4-aaf6-65ffa68c7021-0
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:06.030
No, if I was the type of person
who maybe was a business

4300836a-69d9-4ee4-aaf6-65ffa68c7021-1
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:08.970
development person who needed to
look up a compound.

73ae8260-6d18-48a0-bc29-c8b35a97929b-0
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:14.523
Yes. Or a company then maybe,
but trying to do complex market

73ae8260-6d18-48a0-bc29-c8b35a97929b-1
00:48:14.523 --> 00:48:18.492
stuff. Yeah, I I'm not
interested. 4 year old, it's not

73ae8260-6d18-48a0-bc29-c8b35a97929b-2
00:48:18.492 --> 00:48:22.957
that relevant. Yeah. And for my
role it's not relevant. So for

73ae8260-6d18-48a0-bc29-c8b35a97929b-3
00:48:22.957 --> 00:48:25.650
some other people's role it
might be.

32328642-3f73-4607-93a1-6b6fc7f2ba44-0
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.880


040ea94d-8273-4859-84e0-343680aed8e7-0
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.276
Yeah, people. I mean, you know,
I mean, I could see Cornell

040ea94d-8273-4859-84e0-343680aed8e7-1
00:48:33.276 --> 00:48:38.090
wanting to needing to do it, but
not wanting to do it on a phone.

f32a98d6-e608-4768-9c5f-559564ef320f-0
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:43.908
I'll wait till I get back to my
hotel room and I'll open up the

f32a98d6-e608-4768-9c5f-559564ef320f-1
00:48:43.908 --> 00:48:47.751
computer. It it's just it's too
it's too much unless you're

f32a98d6-e608-4768-9c5f-559564ef320f-2
00:48:47.751 --> 00:48:49.160
doing a simple lookup.

03850fea-99b6-4659-919a-33ae1c457fc7-0
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.858
OK. That that's great for you,
but we'll give that back. Cool.

03850fea-99b6-4659-919a-33ae1c457fc7-1
00:48:53.858 --> 00:48:56.500
So yeah. No, no more questions
for me, I promise.

fbc4ad53-ff04-4452-b350-9f9d49bcd580-0
00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:00.397
Images that we've got a few
minutes. No, that's OK that

fbc4ad53-ff04-4452-b350-9f9d49bcd580-1
00:49:00.397 --> 00:49:02.690
there was a light day today in
terms of meetings.

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-0
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.699
OK, that's good to hear. So what
we'll do after this is, um, like

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-1
00:49:07.699 --> 00:49:11.268
Magna said, you, you have access
to the new platform. You'll have

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-2
00:49:11.268 --> 00:49:14.784
an evaluate beta button when you
log in. It'll be a blue one and

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-3
00:49:14.784 --> 00:49:18.299
just sort of next to the search
bar. So yeah, we would, we would

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-4
00:49:18.299 --> 00:49:21.598
encourage you to go and play
around yourself. And there is a

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-5
00:49:21.598 --> 00:49:25.005
feedback survey. Uh, if you go
onto the platform in the bottom

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-6
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:28.359
left, you've got like a purple
paper plane icon. If you click

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-7
00:49:28.359 --> 00:49:31.604
that, there's two options. You
could just give feedback and

39a32032-7ea5-46f6-804d-fe2ab6b66d1e-8
00:49:31.604 --> 00:49:34.199
just say what you want.
Open-ended text box or.

a3922a26-22d7-438c-920b-a6ddbd1b4393-0
00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:37.365
There's also a specific survey
that you could fill out. Um, so

a3922a26-22d7-438c-920b-a6ddbd1b4393-1
00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:40.323
there's about roughly about 20
questions that take about 5-6

a3922a26-22d7-438c-920b-a6ddbd1b4393-2
00:49:40.323 --> 00:49:43.475
minutes to fill out. But if it's
just right, if it's just little

a3922a26-22d7-438c-920b-a6ddbd1b4393-3
00:49:43.475 --> 00:49:46.482
bits of specific feedback, just
click, give feedback and then

a3922a26-22d7-438c-920b-a6ddbd1b4393-4
00:49:46.482 --> 00:49:49.150
you'll get presented with a box
and an option to like.

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-0
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:53.366
Pays any screenshots or anything
like that. So yeah, I'll, I'll

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-1
00:49:53.366 --> 00:49:56.283
follow up on the e-mail. I'll,
I'll just, um, I'll give you the

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-2
00:49:56.283 --> 00:49:58.972
details on e-mail as well. So
you've got it in writing and

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-3
00:49:58.972 --> 00:50:01.753
then if you can do that, that
would be absolutely brilliant.

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-4
00:50:01.753 --> 00:50:04.670
Um, if not, then your feedback
today and Cornell's feedback has

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-5
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.450
been absolutely amazing. So
we'll pass that back to the team

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-6
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.093
and then what we'll also do is,
you know, going through a

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-7
00:50:10.093 --> 00:50:12.965
process of speaking to numerous
customers, once we've gathered

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-8
00:50:12.965 --> 00:50:15.791
the feedback, we've identified,
you know, what we're going to

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-9
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:18.571
take on board and how we're
going to address that. I'll then

cdb36ced-1bbc-4485-bc0f-aa81599a5332-10
00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:20.440
reach out in sort of two or
three weeks.

a21e9d0d-8818-4459-adef-8ca89d64c553-0
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.777
Just to show you this is what
you said and this is what we're

a21e9d0d-8818-4459-adef-8ca89d64c553-1
00:50:23.777 --> 00:50:27.015
going to do, just to close that
loop so that sound OK and I can

a21e9d0d-8818-4459-adef-8ca89d64c553-2
00:50:27.015 --> 00:50:30.253
always tell when I'm speaking,
even if I didn't hear an accent,

a21e9d0d-8818-4459-adef-8ca89d64c553-3
00:50:30.253 --> 00:50:31.620
I would know you were Brit.

8939b5c4-52e4-4db6-b8e6-6c728f2af5fa-0
00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:35.360
With the brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant.

e7cb5bd2-fd08-444a-a379-f666cab0ffff-0
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:37.850
That is.

2de68b1a-6f49-4a68-969b-252ac06ed7bb-0
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.380
Sometimes it's not even the full
word. It's just a Brill. And

2de68b1a-6f49-4a68-969b-252ac06ed7bb-1
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.490
sometimes it doesn't. Just five
letters. Yeah, just 5 letters.

5ce6aded-dbc5-4f3e-89f7-a3407afa344b-0
00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:51.182
My favorite talk show ever
invented is the Graham Norton

5ce6aded-dbc5-4f3e-89f7-a3407afa344b-1
00:50:51.182 --> 00:50:51.540
Show.

a8a1b448-5c95-4006-95a9-dcff84ebaed4-0
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.510
And.

d8a16616-4775-4b1a-824c-09c5bb632d5b-0
00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.270
And they just get one.

28acfdcf-84e3-4807-bb63-226f21faa31c-0
00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:02.157
I only found that in the last
couple years due to COVID and me

28acfdcf-84e3-4807-bb63-226f21faa31c-1
00:51:02.157 --> 00:51:04.530
spending too much time on my
phone and.

45b9ba26-4640-4bba-b65a-f3871ccec395-0
00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:10.470
It is far and away the best talk
show.

607d5ebc-b42f-48f5-bf6e-36b5d85544b8-0
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:15.300
On the planet. And we've been
doing it for like 25 years or

607d5ebc-b42f-48f5-bf6e-36b5d85544b8-1
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.610
something, but it's.
